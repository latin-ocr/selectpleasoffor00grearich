XXX INTRODUCTION

venison for sustenance. It is easier to suppose that the swanimotes
were authorised to enable the forest Officers to superintend the
depasturing of pigs in the king’s woods in the autumn and the
clearance 01 the forest of cattle and sheep while the deer were fawning
in the summer. The subjects of agistment, pannage and fawning
would hardly be mentioned after the dates 01 111050 assemblies, if
these were not the principal subjects 101 which they were to be held.l
We shall see presently that the word ‘ swanimote’ was a vague word
used both of the attachment courts and the forest inquisitione.

The Attachment court.

Many rolls² of attachment courts still exist at the Record Office
which show clearly the nature of their jurisdiction. In general they were
held every forty-two days, always on the same day of the week in the
several bailiwicks into which a forest might be dividedfor 1110 purpose.
Thus they were held ³ at Linby, Calverton, Mansfield and Edwinstone,
in the forest of Sherwood‚ on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday respectively in every sixth week ς 311(1 111 111051 01 1110 011101
1010515 01 which we have now rolls of attachment courts they seem
to have been held at the same intervals. There were, however, excep-
tions: for instance, in two of the bailiwicks of the forest⁴¹ 01 Ingle-
wood they were held every twenty-eighth instead of every forty-second
day.

The jurisdiction of the court was small. It had no authority to
try or even to inquire j udicially into cases relating to the venison,5 and
the rolls 011110 0011115 may be searched in vain for such a case. This

² The earliest is one of attachments held
in the forest of Galtres in Yorkshire in
17 Ed. i. The heading of the enrolment
of these courts was in the following form :
⁸ Attachiamenta apud Hoby die Sabati prox-
ima ante festum sancti Marci Ewangeliste
anno regni regis Edwardi decimo septimo.'
Courts were held in this st every forty-
second day. (For. Proc. Tr. f Rec. No. 237.)

A roll of attachments held in the forest
of Inglewood in 23 Edward i. is at the
Public Record Office. The heading 01 1110
earliest 01 111050 courts is as follows, ‘Per-
quisita de attachiamentis foreste de Engil-
wude.’ The headings of subsequent 0011115
011 1110 531110 1011 are simply ‘Perquisita
foreste? At this time the courts were held

⁴ Twelve attachment courts were held in
every year in this forest towards the end
of the reign of Edward ii. In one baili-
wick they were held on Wednesdays and in
the other on Thursdays. (Accounts, Exch.
Q. R„ Bundle 131, No. 22.)

⁵ Trespasses against the venison were
investigated in inquisitions made by four
neighbouring townships before the foresters
and verderers. Sometimes, no doubt, these
inquisitions were made on the same day as
that on which a court of attachments was
held. (See p. xlv note 5 below.) But it was
the usual practice 101 1110 inquisition to
be held soon after the offence had been
committed.
