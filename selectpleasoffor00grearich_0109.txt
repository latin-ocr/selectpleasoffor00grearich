THE EXTENP OF THE FORESTs Ci

Buckingham and Warwick, but the explanation may well be that he
was not dissatisfied with their work.

In the course of the next two years the perambulations which had
been made in the remaining counties were examined. Where districts
had been Wrongly disafforested they were reafforested. But the
king neither repudiated the Charter of the Forest nor annulled the
perambulations which had been made in his infancy. He merely
corrected ¹ them, after due inquiry. Where Henry ΙΙ. had afforested
a district for the first time it was no longer allowed to remain in the
forest, but where he had reafforested what had been forest before the
civil wars of the reign of Stephen the perambulations were to that
extent set aside.

But although the revision of the perambulations was neither
unjust nor umeasonable, it was, as might be expected, unpopular.
People who had enjoyed complete immunity from the forest laws would
resent their reimposition, whether it was just or unjust. Among
the articles which formed the barons' petition in the year 1260 was
one which gave expression to the feeling of dissatisfaction.²

Item petunt remedium quod bosci 61 16116 infra metas foreste non
existentes, qui per ambulacionem proborum hominum, et per quindecimam
partem omnium bonorum hominum Anglie domino regi datam deafforestati
fuerunt, per uoluntatem suam reafforestauit.

Nevertheless the barons did not succeed in obtaining redress for
this particular grievance. On several occasions during the reign of
Henry ΠΙ. 1116 Charter was confirmed, but the confirmations were
never followed by fresh perambulations and the boundaries of the
forest remained the same after the battle of Evesham as they were
before it. Nor was Edward Ι. willing that the boundaries of the
forest as settled by his father should be disturbed. It was only at the
end of his reign, under strong politica] pressure, that he consented
to the disafforestment of any 1101110116 of his forests. In March 1277
he had directed ³ Walter ScameL and Mathew de Colombieres to cause
a perambulation 10 be made of the forests south of the Trent.

¹ Thus the concluding words of the
writ to the sheriff of Hampshire concerning

the revision of the perambulations in that
county are as follows :

¹ Et ideo tibi precipimus quod sine dila-

cione clamari facias per totam balliuam⁴

tuam quod foresta custodiatur per eosdem
terminos et easdem metas per quas cus-
todita fuit tempore I. regis patris nostri
ante gwerram motam inter ipsum et barones
suos Anglie exceptis partibus predictis quas

dictus Henricus rex auus noster 660166-
161111 ; 61 firmiter prohiberi facias quod
nullus in eadem foresta de uiridi uel uena-
cione forisfaciat contra assisam foreste
nostre, 61 quod arcus et sagitte brachetti ct
leporarii inde penitus amoueantur.’ (Closc
