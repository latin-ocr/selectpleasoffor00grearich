THE EXTENT OF THE Fonnsrs cvii

boundaries can only be ascertained by collecting the names 01 all
places mentioned in the rolls as lying within the forest.

Until the boundaries of the different forests have been carefully
ascertained it will be impossible to state even approximately how
much 01 1116 kingdom was forest in the thirteenth century. In some
counties there were no forests. Among the writs by which the
Parliament 01 Lincoln 01 1300 was summoned was one¹ which was
addressed to the sheriffs of the counties in which there were 1016616.
11 16 followed on the roll of letters close by a writ2 to the sheriff
of Lincoln and a statement that in the same manner an order was
sent to the sheriffs of the counties in which there were 1101016616-
namely, Norfolk‚ Suffolk, Cambridge, Bedford, Kent‚ SusseX‚ Middle-
seX, Leicester, Northumberland‚ Cornwall, Lancaster, and Hertford.
In some of these counties there had been forests which in the year
1300 were forests no longer. By a chartei· dated 3 May 1204 king
John disafforested³ the marsh appurtenant to four towns in Lin-
colnshire—namely, Surfleet, Gosberchurch, Quadring and Doning-
ton—so that it is evident that there was a forest in that county
at the beginning 01 1116 thirteenth century.⁴¹ The same king, by a
charter dated 22 March in the sanie year disafforested5 all the
county of Comwall, except two moors and two groves, which he
disafforested later in his reign. He also disafforested by a charter 6
dated 18 May 1204 all the county of Devon, except Dartmoor and
Exmoor. On 10 October 1239 Henry ΠΙ. granted⁷ the forest of
Dartmoor to his brother Richard earl 01 Cornwall. A portion 01 1116
forest of ExmoorS still remained in the county of Devon; but with
this exception 111616 was no forest in Devonshire after the year 1239.
A considerable portion 01 1116 county of Leicester was forest until
20 February 1233, when it was disafforested ⁹ by king Henry ΙΙΙ. in
accordance with the first chapter 01 1116 Charter of the Forest. 111
