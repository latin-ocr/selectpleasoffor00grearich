men who held lands of the Crown in the time of king John by the
service 01 guarding the forest. Sometimes, too, it could be shown
that their ancestors were holding the same Iands by the same service
early in the twelfth century. Many 01 1110111, 110 doubt, were

hereditary wardens than foresters in 100, according to the usage 01

however, were undoubtedly foresters in 100, and subordinate to a

of the lands within his forests. The residue included extensive
woods, over which the owners enjoyed most of the ordinary rights
of property. In fact, the only limitation upon their rights may be
expressed briefiy by saying that they could do nothing by which the
woods would cease to afford shelter for the beasts 01 1110 forest. In
precise language, they could not make ‘ essart 2 purpresture or waste ’
without the king’s licence. Now in order to protect their rights
they, like other landowners outside the forest, required the assistance
01 an official bearing a close resemblance to a royal forester. His
principa] duty was to attach trespassers in their woods and compel
them to make answer for their offences. But these officials were
made by the forest laws to serve two masters. They were compelled
to protect the king's venison as well as their masters’ woods. Every
