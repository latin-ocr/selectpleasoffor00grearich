xviii INTRODUCTION

Stamford and Oxford by letters patent dated 22 October 1252, was de—
scribed¹ on the eyre rolls of 1255 as ‘ chief steward of the forest ' ; and
other wardens are elsewhere described as ‘ stewards' without even the
addition of the word ‘ chief.’ Unf01·tunate1y;t11e title ‘ steward‚’ which,
if it had been applied solely to wardens, could have caused no
ambiguity, was often applied to persons who were not wardens. Thus
Geoffrey of Childwick² and Geoffrey de Mortemer3 are respectively
described on the Huntingdon eyre rolls as stewards of the forest; and
William of Northampton ‘¹ is similarly described in the Northampton
eyre rolls of the same year. Now it is quite certain that none of these
people were wardens of the forest, because a complete series of the
wardens of this period can be compiled from the patent rolls which
record the letters patent by which they were appointed. 1f, however,
Geoffrey of Childwick and the other persons styled stewards were not
wardens, they must have been deputy wardens called stewards for
want osa better name. A few years later tho word lieutenant‚ ‘ locum
tenens: came into use to describe their position. Adam of Nailford,
for example, acted as deputy for Elias de Hauville,⁵ who was warden
of the forests between the bridges of Staniford and Oxford in the year
1292. In an inquisition 6 held in Rockingham forest on the ath March
1294 Adam is described in one place as ‘subsenescallus’ or ‘sub-
steward‚⁷ and in another as ‘locum tenens Elye de Hauuile.’

It was possible for a warden to assign his office, or a portion of
his bailiwick, with the consent of the king. Thus Richard de Mun-
fiquet, or de Munfichet,⁷ granted the wardenship of the forest of
Essex to Gilbert of Clare in the year 1267 with the king’s consent.
Again in 12ὅὲ Warin of Bassingbourn, who was then warden ⁸ of the
for-ests between the bridges of Stamford and Oxford, granted the forest
of Weybridge, which was part of his bailiwick, to Robert le Loup 9 for
life, and the king on 20 February 126} confirmed the grant by his
letters patent. On 5 June 1275 Edward Ι. granted this then recently
created bailiwick of the forest of Weybridge‚ which had become
vacant, to a certain John of Fransham ¹⁰ for his life without the ex-
press consent of the warden of the forest between the two bridges ; and
