THE ΟΗΑΞΕ, THE PARK ΑΜ) THE WARREN cxxxiii

barons' petition at that parliament is thus set out in the annals
of Burton ε

Item petunt remedium quod foreste deafforestate per cartam regis et per
fidem eidem per communitatem totius regni factam, ita quod quisque ubique
possit fugare, dominus rex de uoluntate sua pluribus dedit de predicta
libertate warennas, que sunt ad nocumentum predicte libertatis concesse.

A few additional words are required to make the text of the
article grammatical. If these be supplied and no further emenda-
tions made it shows that the barons complained that the king had
granted warrens in the districts which had been put out of the forest
at the beginning of the reign. The barons seem to have considered
that the disafforestment of a district implied a pledge that the public
should be at liberty to hunt in it at pleasure. But it is not easy to
see why the disafforested districts should be in any better position
with respect to warrens than lands which had never been afforested.
There was certainly no legislation on the subject in consequence
of the petition, but it is possible that the king remembered the
barons’ complaint when applicatione were made to him for new
charters of warren.

The justices of the forest were not concerned with the king's
warrens unless they happened to lie within the boundaries of a royal
forest. Nevertheless the justices in eyre for pleas'of the forest, when
sitting at Huntingdon in 13 Edward Ι., heard pleas¹ of the warren
of Cambridge, which was not subject to the forest laws. This,
however, was an exceptional case, and no pleas relating to other
warrens lying outside the forests are to be found on the forest eyre
rolls of the thirteenth century. Evidently the king’s rights in such
of his warrens as were not parcel of his forests were enforced in the
ordinary courts of law. But it is a question whether all the king's
demesnes were treated as warrens or not. That he could enwarren
his own property at pleasure hardly admits of doubt, seeing that he
could create a warren in the demesne lands of any of his subjectS.
But he may in some cases have refrained from exercising his right;
and it is not improbable that the right of hunting beasts of the
warren was only reserved by the king in those demesnes where some

profit or pleasure was to be obtained by his so doing.
