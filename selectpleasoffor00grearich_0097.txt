THE omno r lxxxix

If on the other hand the clerk duly appeared in court the justices
would proceed with his case just as if he were a layman3 and would
sentence him to prison. But if the bishop then claimed him as a
clerk, the justices would surrender him as one convicted of an offence
against the forest laws. Thus, at the Northampton forest eyre of
1256, two clerks, John the son of John Caperun and William the son
of the parson of Thornhaugh were committed to prison. The recordl
of the case continues thus :

Et super hoc uenerunt magistri Walterus decanus N orhamt' et Willelmus
de Lindes’ atornati episcopi Lync' ad recipiendos clericos a prisona coram
iusticiariis‚ et pecierunt dictum Iohannem filium Iohannis Caperun3 et
liberatur eisdem tanquam clericus. Et quia uxoratus est et habet laicum
feodum, preceptum est uicecomiti quod capiat terram etc. ; ita quod manum
etc. Et postea uenit Iohannes Gaperun et finiuit per quadraginta solidos.

Postea uenerunt magistri Walterus decanus Norhamt' et Willelmus de
Lyndes’ et pecierunt Willelmum filium persone de Tornhawe, eo quod
clericus est ; et liberatur eisdem tanquam conuictus et apertus malefactor de
uenacione‚ quia dicti magistri fuerunt atornati episcopi Lync’ per litteras
patentes ad petendum clericos inprisonatos coram iusticiariis. . . . Et
postea uenit Willelmus filius persone de Tornhawe, et finiuit per unam
marcam.

The actual form of the letters patent which the bishops used on

these occasions is recorded on one of the rolls ² of the Wiltshire eyre
of1257:

Nouerint uniuersi presentes literas inspecturi quod nos E. dei paciencia
Sar' ecclesie minister humilis dilecto filio decano de Wylton’ committimus
uices nostras quociens nosmetipsos uel officialem nostrum generalem abesse
contigerit. Et in huius rei fidem et testimonium presentibus sigillum nostrum

duximus apponi. Date apud Bromhal’ quindecimo die Iunii anno gracie
mcclvij.

But although a clerk might be delivered to the bishop as one con-
victed of a trespass in the forest, he did not escape punishment. He
had to make fine just as if he were a layman. This is evident from
the case of William the son of the parson of Thornhaugh, who,
although delivered to the attorneys of the bishop of Lincoln, subse-
quently made fine by a mark. Indeed it frequently happens that the
record merely states that the clerk made fine without stating that he
had been delivered to the bishop. In such cases either the clerk
made fine without waiting to be delivered, or the record is silent

about the delivery, because as the fact led to no profit to the king, there
