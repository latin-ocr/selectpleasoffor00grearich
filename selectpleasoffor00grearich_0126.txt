tempore predicti Roberti solebant fere domini regis fugari in parcur

modi fuga se intromisit.

By an inquisition¹ held at Kinver in March 1333, concerning th
state 01 1116 forest of Kinver, it was found that the prior 0
Worcester held a park more than two leagues distant 110111 1116 6017611
01 1116 101661, in which there was a deer leap to the king's damage.

Et quod prior sancte Marie Wygorn’ tenet quemdam parcum, qui uocatur
Eymor, qui distat a cooperto foreste predicte per duas leucas et amplius
super quo est unum saltatorium per quod fere domini regis in eodem intrare
possunt ad dampnum domini regis.

Even if a park which was close to a forest had no deer 16611, 11
would seem that it might· be considered a nuisance. In the reign
01 Ε(111761·(1 Ι. 111616 11766 6 116111 about a (1116116101 6 league outside
the free chase 01 1116117616. The lord of the chase proceeded against
the owner 01 1116 116111 in 13116 court of the king’s bench, with the
result that 1116 justices, besides ordering the deer leaps in the park
to be removed, also ordered the park 10 be made open.² 11 6 park
close 10 6 free chase might be considered a nuisance 10 the chase,
a park similarly situate with respect to a royal forest must un-
doubtedly have been considered a nuisance 10 the forest.³ Thus the
presentment already mentioned concerning the park 01 1661161 01
Clifsord at Whinfell contains a statement that her ancestor had en-
larged it 10 1116 nuisance of the forest. Probably the objection 10 6
park in the neighbourhood 01 6 101661 was that, even if it contained
no deer 16611, 1116 1166616 of the forest might easily find their way
into it at points where the paling was out of repair, and might
have difficulty in finding their way out again. There would always
be a temptation to the owner 10 6111166 1116 king’s deer into his park
for his own use.⁴

In the early years 01 1116 reign of Henry ΙΠ. deer stealing in parks
was not an offence reckoned among the Pleas 01 1116 men, nor
