civ INTRonUCTION
appointed commissioners ¹ to go through all the counties of England to
inquire into the misdeeds of the forest Officers and of those who were
in arrear in making the perambulations. From this it seems that
the forest chartei· was to be enforced as far as it related to the
oppression of the inhabitants, and that the king intended the
boundaries‚ such as they were, to be respected by the foresters.

In April 1299 a new statute‚2 the ‘ Statutum de Finibus Leuatis‚’
was enacted which incorporated all the Charter of the Forest, except
the first five articles. Although the articles in the Charter which
relate to disafforestment were omitted from the statute, there is a
clause in it which declares that the king was willing that a perambu-
lation should be made ‘ saving always his oath, the right of his crown,
and his exceptions and challenges, and those of other persons ⁵ but
‘ so that such perambulation be reported to him before any execution
or anything else be done thereupon.’ Five justices,³ allos whom were
judges of great experience, were directed‚⁴ by letters patent dated
23 September, to make perambulations of the forests north and south
of the Trent. Perambulations⁵ were made by these justices in five
counties, namely, Northampton, Huntingdon, Rutland, Oxford and
Surrey. It is probable‚ however, that they performed their work too
slowly to satisfy anybody ; for on 1 April 1300 the king again directed ⁶
perambulations to be made, this time by six sets of justices each in a
particular group ⁷ of countieS. The letters patent by which they were
appointed contained reservations similar to those in the Statute of
Fines, concerning the king's rights and the execution of the peram-
bulations. In most of the forests the jurors paid no attention to the
settlement of the boundaries made at the beginning of the reign of
Henry ΠΙ. They put out of the forest vast tracts of land which had
been forest for a century and a half, alleging that they had been

served that, with the exception of Oxtord,
none of the five counties in which peram-
bulations are known to have been made
pur-suant to the letters patent of 23 Sep-
tember 1299 are included in the above six
groups. It is probable that no perambula-
tion was made in Oxfordshire pursuant to
the letters patent of 1 April 1300, as the
(lisafforestment of 14 Feb. 1301 was based
upon a perambulation made on the 22
