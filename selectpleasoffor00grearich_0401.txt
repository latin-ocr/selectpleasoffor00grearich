SOMERSET, An 1⁴27} 126

3. Although the charter says that view 01 1110 lawing of dogs ought
to be made every third year, when the regard is made, and 111011 by view
of loyal men and good, and not otherwise, yet the foresters come
through the towns blowing horns and make a nuisance with much noise
to cause the mastiffs to come out to bark at them; and 00 they attach
the good folk every year 101· their mastiffs if the three toes be not cut and
a little piece from the ball 01 1110 right foot, although the chartei· says
that the three toes are to be cut but not the ball of the fore foot.

4. Although the charter says that by view and by oath 01 twelve
· regarders, when they make their regard, as many foresters are to be
set to guard the forest as to them shall seem reasonably sufficient,
yet the chief forester sets foresters beneath him, riding and walking,
at his pleasure without the view of anybody‚ and more than are
sufficient to guard the lawful forest, in return 101· their giving as

6. And besides this they collect lambs and little pigs‚ wool, and
ilari, from every house where there is wool a fieece, and in fence
