lviii INTRODUCTION

Alan la Zouche¹ and Roger of Clifford who were included in the
commissions of 46 Henry ΠΙ. and 53 Henry HI. respectively were
justices 01 1116 forest south of the Trent‚ while William ² de Vescy and
Ralph de Neville, who were among the itinerant justices at Notting-
ham in 15 Edward I. and 8 Edward ΙΙΙ. respectively, were justices
01 1116 forest north 01 1116 Trent. It was a remarkable feature of the
eyre of William le Breton which began in June 1255 and ended in
the spring of 1258, 11161 neither he nor any one of his colleagues was
a justice 01 1116 forest. At the beginning 01 1116 eyre Arnold ³ de Bois
held the office, but on the 1st September 1256, 116 was succeeded by
Robert Walerand4 who was still justice 01 1116 forest south of the
Trent when the eyre closed.

The forest justices in eyre were usually men 01 some position.
William le Breton⁵ held lands 01 1116 king in chief; and had been
sheriffof 1116 county 01 Essex. He was a lawyer who from time to
time filled various offices. He was one 01 1116 justices assigned for
the custody of the Jews in 36 Henry ΠΙ. Η6 was more than once a
justice in eyre for pleas of the crown and common pleas, and he was
for many years constantly employed as a justice specially com-
missioned to take particular assizes.

Geoffrey 01 Lewknor‚ one 01 1116 colleagues 01 William 16 Breton,
had a very similar career. He was at 0116 time a justice assigned
for the custody of the Jews ; he was also more than once a justice in
eyre for pleas 01 1116 crown and common pleas ; and he was fre-
quently commissioned to take particular assizes. Unlike William le
Breton, who was only an itinerant forest justice late in life, Geoffrey
of Lewknor was employed in this way early in his official career.

Nicholas 01 Romsey was a man who seems never to have per-
formed any important duties, either judicia] or administrative,
except as an itinerant forest justice. He was one 01 1116 colleagues
of William le Breton in 1255, 01 Alan la Zouche in 1262, 01 Roger

¹ Alan la Zouche and Roger 01 clifford
were appointed by letters patent dated
12 June 1261 and 8 August 1265 re-
spectively. (866 Patent Roll 74, m. 10,
and Patent Roll 82, m. 11.) Ι1 is pro-
116016 11161 Roger 01 Clifford was not a
justice in eyre in all the eounties, as he
was succeeded in the office 01 justice 01 1116
forest south 01 1116 Trent by Roger 01
Clifford junior, who was appointed to the
office by letters patent dated 1 August 1270.
(866 Fine Roll 67, m. 5.) Ι1 should be
noticed that at the Somerset eyre which
began on 23 May 1270 1116 place 01 Roger
of Clifford was taken by Henry 01 Burghill.
