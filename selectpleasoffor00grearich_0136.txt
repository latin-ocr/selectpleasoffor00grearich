he took the hounds ‘ as in the warren of· his lord.' The plaintiff
replied that his men were in pursuit of a buck in their common
chase, where they and all the country could hunt the buck, and
demanded that the defendant’s lord should corne and claim his
warren. Afterwards a monk of the abbot carne and produced a
charter which granted the abbey of St. Albans warren in all its
demesne lands in England. Nevertheless, the court declared that
the defendant should be in mercy, on the ground that the buck was
not a beast of the warren.

Et quia predictus Thomas cognouit predictam capcionem canum et canes
predicti Philippi non currerunt ad aliquam bestiam de warenna, immo ad

quemdam damum qui non est bestia de warenna, ideo predictus Thomas sit
in misericordia.

Again, in the year 1293 William de Colleville, on being summoned ¹
before Hugh of Cressingham and his fellows, justices in eyre at York,
to answer by what warrant he claimed to have free warren in his
demesne lands, produced a charter from Henry ΠΙ. granting free
warren therein to a certain Robert Ingram, ancestor to William.
Thereupon Roger of Higham, on behalf of the king, sought that it
should be inquired if William was the heir of Robert. He further
objected on behalf of the king that william, under the authority of
the charter to Robert Ingram‚ kept large beasts such as harts and
hinds, bucks and does, and such like in defense, in the towns in
which warren was claimed, and sought that an inquiry should be
made 00 to this and other matters. To other charters of warren
produced at the same eyre, 110 raised 0 similar objection. From the
year 1338, however, the roe was, as explained on an earlier page,
considered to be a beast of the warren.²

There can be little doubt that the hare was the principal beast of
the warren. Not only is it sometimes expressly mentioned in charters
of warren, but it forms the subject of by far the greater number of

2 Before the decision of the king's bench
mentioned on p. xi above, the roe was un-
doubtedly not considered a beast of the war-
ren. 111 a ease before the king's justiees at
Appleby in 20 Ed. i. a respondent stated
that, he did not claim free chase in certain
lande but only free warren. The king's
attorney thereupon replied that the respon-
dent kept in defense harts, hinds and roes
which did 1101 belong to warren :

·Et W. 1. dicit pro domino rege quod
predictus P. usus est predicta libera chacia

01 tenet in defenso in eadem ceruos et
bissas et cheuerellos cuiusmodi bestie ad
warennam non pertinent? (Placita de Quo
Waranto, p. 787. See also ibid. p. 789.)
But even before the decisiou the

might be made a beast of the warren in a
particular place by royal charter. Thus in
12 Heu. iii. the king granted Peter fitz
Herbert warren in certain lande for the fox,
the hare and the roe. (Charter Roll 20.
