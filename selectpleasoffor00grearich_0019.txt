THE BEASTS OF THE FoREs'r Xl

warren, on the ground that it drove away the other deer. The cir-
cumstances in which this decision was given and its terms deserve
notice. In the forest eyre of 12 Ed. III. Henry de Percy put forward
a claim to have woodwards carrying bows and arrows in his woods
in his manor of Seamer, which was within the forest of Pickering‚
and also to have the right of hunting and taking roes, as well within
the covert of the forest as outside. The Earl of Lancaster, to whom
the king had granted the forest and all his rights over it, opposed
the latter of these claims 011 the ground that the roe was a beast of the
forest, and that the right demanded was against the assize of the
forest. It must here be observed that it was not uncommon for the
king to make grants of the right of hunting hares and foxes in his
forests; and it may be presumed that the owner of a forest such as
the Earl of Lancaster would do the same. So, too, certain forest
officials claimed the right¹ of hunting the hare and the fox as ap-
pendant to their offices. There are, however, no instances of a right
of hunting any kind of deer being exercised except by the king
or the owner of a forest. No ordinance is extant which deals with
the subject3 but probably all that the Earl meant when he pleaded
that the right demanded was against the assize of the forest was that
it was without precedent and against policy. The justices in eyre
adjourned the claim for consideration by the Court of King's Bench,
which gave judgment as follows ε

Et super hoc uisis et examinatis clameis ac recordo et processu predictis
et habito inde tractatu et diligenti deliberacione 011111 cancellario thesaurario
iusticiariis et aliis de consilio domini regis, quod licet tempore domini
Edwardi quondam regis Angl' aui domini regis nunc quo tempore predicta
foresta fuit in manu ipsius aui domini regis nunc transgressores, qui
conuicti erant de capcione capriolorum‚ fecerunt finem ut pro transgressione
uenacionis foreste, prout per recordum predicti Willelmi de Uescy et sociorum
suorum est compertum, uidetur tamen iusticiariis hic et consilio domini regis
quod caprioli sunt bestie de warenna et non de foresta eo quod fugant alias
feras de foresta.

Thus the roe ceased to be a beast of the forest in consequence of
a kind of judicial ordinance, a decision given after consultation with
the great Officers of state, based, not upon precedent 01· analogy, but
upon the broad ground of practical convenience.

The remaining beast of the forest was the wild boarff' which was
