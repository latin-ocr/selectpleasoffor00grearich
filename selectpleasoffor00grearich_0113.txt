THE EXTENT OF THE FORESTS cv

afforested by Henry ΙΙ. or his sons Richard and John, and disregard-
ing the distinction between districts which had been afforested 101· 1116
first time and those which had been reafforested as ancient forest by
Henry H. When they were asked what were their means 01 know-
ledge, they declared¹ that they knew from the tales 01 111611 6110661016
and the common talk 01 1116 country.

On 25 September 1300 the king directed ² the justices before
whom the recent perambulations had been made to attend a parlia-
ment which was to be held at Lincoln 011 25 January of the following
year with a view to considering what they had done 3 and a day later
the sheriffs were ordered to cause all who had lands and tenements
within the forest and who wished to challenge anything in the
perambulations to come to the parliament and show their reasons.
The justices 01 1116 101661 north and south 01 1116 Τ1·6111 were also
ordered to cause the attendance of the foresters in 166, 110 doubt 101·
1116 661116 reason as that for which they had been summoned in the
reign 01 Henry ΠΙ. 011 14 February the king confirmed the Charter
01 1116 Forest and issued letters patent 3 disafforesting 611 districts
which lay outside the boundaries found in the recent perambulations.

The disafforestments made 61 1116 Ρ611161116111 01 Lincoln were not
final. They had been extorted from the king under political pressure ;
there is good reason for supposing that they infringed his rights. It
is not surprising, therefore, 11161 116 applied 10 1116 lord the pope for
161161. 011 29 December 1305 Clement V. revoked‚‘¹ annulled, and
quashed the grants which the king had made, and shortly 61161·-
wards the king⁴³ himself revoked and annulled his own grants and dis-
afforestments.

⁵ It 16 clear that the king revoked the
disafforestments which he granted at the

Parliament of Lincoln. The fifth chapter
of the Statute 011116 year 1306, known
as ‘Ordinatio Foreste,' begins as follows :

‘ Quoad illos uero, qui tempore quo foresta
deafforestata fuit, transgressiones de uiridi
aut venacione in foresta-fecerunt, quia
deafforestacionem eandem et ut sentencia
excommunicacionis in contrauenientes ful-
minaretur quamquam de nostra bona
uoluntate minime processisset, concessimus,
quam quidem sentenciam dominus summus
pontifex postmodum reuocauit, et quas
concessionem et (16611016616010116111 ex certis
causis reuocamus et eciam adnullamus,
uolumus quod transgressiones huiusmodi
perdonentur, transgressionibus illis exceptis,
que in ea parte que foresta remansit com-
misse fuerunt.' (Stcztzctes of the Realm,
i. 149.)
