THE Fonnsr EYRE lxvii

Although on the eyre rolls of the reign of Henry ΠΙ. charters
and letters patent conferring rights and privileges within the forest
were seldom enrolled, the practice of enrolling them became general
in the reign of his successor, Edward Ι. There are more than sixty
grants of this nature on the rolls¹ of the Essex eyre of 1277, which
include a considerable number of twelfth century charters.

It was the duty of every owner of a wood within a forest to present
his woodward to the justice of the forest, in order that 116 might take
an oath of fealty before him concerning the king's venison. But a
presentment before this official was not sufficient,² for at every forest
eyre the owners were again required to present their woodwards to
13116 justices in eyre, before whom they were again sworn. Sometimes
a presentment was made for the first time before the warden or deputy
warden of the forest, but this was only a provisional presentment
until the owner and 1116 woodward could come before the justice. It
would seem from entries on the eyre 10116 11161 011 1116 appointment of
a new justice of the forest existing woodwards were often presented ³
and sworn before him.

In most of the files of rolls of the eyre of William 16 Breton and
his fellows in 1255 and the two following years there are entries
relating to the presentment of the woodwards; but in subsequent
eyres they 616 1101 10 be found. The following are a few entries
from the 8011161661 65716 ⁴ of 1257.
