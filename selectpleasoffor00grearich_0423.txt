GLOSSAR Y 143

frater S. nunc abbas . . . receperunt. . . .
Et ideo tibi precipimus quod, si ita est,
tunc tot iusta quot eidem abbati aretro
sunt de numero illo . . . habere facias
(Rot. Litt. Claros. i. p. 590).

The same fact shows that the word was
not applied to trees of a particular
species, for ‘robur ' was used both of
oaks and beeches: perhaps, also of other
trees. This again is evident from the
marginal note ‘De fustis ad focum
regis' on a close roll, to which the
corresponding entry is as follows:
Mandatum est . . . . quod ob cap-
cionem centum et quinquaginta quer-

curm et centum spinarum . . . . (CZose
Rolz 65, m. 22).

Finally, the word was applied, not only
to dwarfed trees such as ‘ robora‚' but
likewise to tall trees. Thus:

Quinque magna et grossa fusta et

longa ad pannas faciendas (Rot. Litt,
Claus. i. p. 522, b).

Duo fuste . . . ad duas uirgas faciendas
ad trubechettum (Rot. Litt. Clazcs. ii.
p. 62, b).

ganderatus (p. 77) and ganderese (p. 96).
These words are used of arrows.
Nothing is said of them in Du
Gange’s Glossarium, and there is
nothing in the context in which they
occur to suggest a meaning⁴ The letter
n in both examples may be read as u,
and the third e in the second form may
be meant for an 0, but the forms adopted
in the text seem to be the true readings.
In the absence of any evidence on
the point it may be suggested that
‘genderatus' is a Latin word formed
from the mediaeval form of the French
ι(1811(11·88,’ which is defined by Littre
as ⁴ eeume de plomb.’ The word would
then signify that there was a hall of
lead at the end of the arrow to prevent
too much penetration into the decr.
The final e in the form ‘genderese ’ is
represented in the manuscript by a
mark oi contractiori which may be a
mere flourish. In this case ⁶ genderes ⁷

would be an attempt at the French
word.

haerieii and haieretti. These words

used adjectively with ⁴ canes ⁴ denoted

a particular breed of running honnds
(see canes currentes). They are fre-

quently mentioned on the close rolls of
the reigns of Ed. ii. and Ed. iii. Thus
we have 2

Mandatum est . .. quod dicto W. de Β.
et R. S. uenatorrbus quos rex mittit cum
uiginti et quatuor canibus haierettis
decem et octo leporariis duobus bernariis
duobus ueutrariis uno bersellettario uno
berseletto et uno lardenario ad capiendos
dames (Glose Roll 133, m. 1).

Although the words may be translated
by ⁴ harriers’ the above example and
many others show that they were prin-
cipally used for hunting deer. Indeed
the words ‘haerieii ’ and ‘haieretti’
seem to have no philological relation
to the word ⁸ hare? Two manors were
held of the king in chief by the service
cf keeping the king's 1111111818, name-ly,
Alderbury in Wiltshire and Buck-
hampton in Berkshire. The following
passages relating to these serjeamties
are of interes-t on account of the
spellings:

bii-⁷ pro qua debuit custodire canes
