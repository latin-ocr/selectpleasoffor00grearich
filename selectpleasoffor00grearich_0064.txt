counties of England south of the river Trent in which there were
forests. They were to begin with the forests in the counties of
Huntingdon‚ Northampton‚ Buckingham and Oxford‚ and to journey
through the other forests in the order which the king should from
time to time direct. They probably held no pleas in Staffordshire,
Worcestershire, Herefordshire and salop, because their services were
wanted elsewhere. It must be remembered that the year 1258 was an
eventful one in English history. A parliament met in London on the
9th April, and on the 2nd May the king assented to the election of
twenty-four persons to prepare a scheme of reforms which were to be
submitted to an adjourned session of the Parliament at Oxford on the
lOth June. The council of twenty-four drew up the famous Provisions
of Oxford, to which the king gave his consent on the 12th October.
While events] such as these were taking place, it is easy to believe
that the presence of the justices in eyre or of some of them was
required at the parliament‚ more especially as certain of the
grievances of the barons related to the king’s forests.

The Periodicity of the Eyre.

We have already seen that in December 1261 the king appointed
Alan la Zouche and two other justices in eyre to hold pleas of the
forest in the group of four counties, which William le Breton left
unvisited in the year 1258. After Alan la Zouche finished his work
in this group, the king by letters patent ² dated the loth April 1262,
appointed him and his two fellows justices in eyre for pleas of the
forest in Huntingdonshire‚ Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire.
It would seem that the king intended them to hold forest pleas in
all the counties of England in which there were forests. But just as
the eyre of William le Breton came to an end without pleas being held
in four counties south of the Trent.in which there were forests‚ so
again the eyre³ of Alan la Zouche was incomplete, and a few

¹ As to these matters of history, see there was an eyre before Alan la Zouche
Stubbs, Constitzctional His-Cory, ed. 1875, and his fellows in Essex in 47 Hen. iii. (See
vol. ii, p. 73. For. Proca, Ex. Q. R„ Buvzdle i.‚ No. 20.)

² Patent Roll 75, m. 12. The rolls of the eyre held in 53 Hen. iii.

³ No records of this eyre now exist, (see p. lvii note 1 below) show conclusively
except the rolls of the Wiltshire eyre, to that no eyre was held by Alan Zouche in
which the reference is For. Proc., T‘r. of 46 Hen. iii„ except in those counties for
Rea„ 199, and of Worcestelshire, Salop which records of an eyre in that year still
and stafford, to which the references have exist, and except also in the counties of
been given above. There is, however, a roll Heresord, Oxford, and perhaps also Buck-
of fines and amercements which show that ingham and Northampton.
