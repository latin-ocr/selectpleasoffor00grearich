THE FOREST EYRE lxxi

33 Henry III.; and two inquisitions of 34 Henry ΙΠ. All the
inquisitions and memoranda, except two, follow one another in
chronological order. After the two inquisitions of 34 Heniy HL
there occurs a series of entries under the heading1 ‘ Venison taken by
the King’s writ,’ and this series of entries is followed by another2
under the heading ‘ Venison taken without warrant.’ Both series of
entries are in chronological order.

There can be little doubt that the roll was transcribed from
original inquisitions and memoranda for the use of the justices in
eyre in the year 1255. The handwriting seems to be the same
throughout. More than one ink may have been used in writing it, but
there is nothing in the appearance of the roll to suggest that it was
written entry by entry at the dates of the occurrences recorded
upon it. The fact that one3 of the inquisitions is out of chrono-
logical order points to the carelessness of a transcriber, while the two
series of entries⁴ concerning venison taken by the King's writ and
without warrant, occurring as they do at the end of the chronological
series of inquisitions and memoranda, are hardly consistent with
piecerneal enrolment.

The first two entries ⁵ on the Northamptonshire eyre rolls of 1255
of pleas of the venison in the forest of Rockingham relate to trespasses
which were committed in 29 Henry HL—that is to say, in the year
before the date of the first entry on the roll of special inquisitions
which we have just been considering. The third entry relates to a
trespass which is undated. Probably a roll containing at least two
inquisitione and a memorandum, to which these first three entries
corresponded, once existed, and has since been lost. To each of the
next thirteen entries on the eyre rolls there are corresponding entries 6
on our roll of special inquisitions and they follow one another in the
same order. Even the entry ⁷ corresponding to the one which is out
of chronological order on the roll of inquisition is out of order on the
eyre rolls3 an error which can hardly be purely accidental in both
cases.

If the two records be carefully collated‚ it is hardly possible to
avoid the conclusion that thirteen consecutive entries on the eyre
rolls are based upon the thirteen corresponding entries on the roll of
special inquisitions. It is true there may have been other records
of special inquisitions which recorded the sanie matters as those in
