lxxviii INTRODUCTION
and chapter by chapter, the clerk of the justices usually drew up an
abstract 01 111056 relating to assai-ts, purprestures and wastes divided
into six paragraphs which between them contained all the informa-
tion required. The paragraphs were entituled respectively, the old
assarts, the new 6556115, 1116 old purprestures, the new purprestures,
the old wasteS, and the new wastes. And each paragraph contained
a series of formal entries, each of which related to a particular assart,
purpresture, or act of waste.

In the ‘Dialogus (le Scaccario ' essartsl are explained as follows ε

Ε556116 11610 uulgo dicuntur que apud Isidorum occationes nominantur ;
quando scilicet foreste nemora uel dumeta quelibet pascuis et latibulis
opportuna succiduntur ; quibus succisis et radicibus auulsis‚ terra subuertitur
et excolitur.

The word seems always to have implied the uprooting of trees and
the reduction of the land on which they stood to cultivation. An
assart might be made either in the covert or in a wood outside the
covert but within the metes and bcunds of the forest. The punish-
ment for a trespass of this nature was an amercement at the next
forest eyre3 but the person who held the assart was also obliged to
pay a further sum for the crops sown upon it, which was assessed as
follows. For every acre of land the payment was a shilling for every
crop of winter corn, and sixpence for every crop of spring corn.2
Usually the same piece of land seems to have been sown alternately
with winter and spring corn, and to have remained fallow for a year
after a certain number of crops had been sown. The record seldom
states the nature of the corn sown in the winter3 but it occasionally
states that an assart has been sown with wheat or rye.³ In such
cases the tenant accounted for the 01011 65 11 11 had been sown in
the winter. On the other hand, the tenant is frequently stated to
have sown his assart with oats,⁴ and as he is always charged with a

³ There are very few instances of rye
(siliqo) being expressly mentioned in the
record 01 6 regard. Some instances occur
in the regard recorded on the Staffordshire
eyre rolls 01 September 1271. (For. Proc„
Tr. of Rea, No. 184.) Instances 01 wheat
being expressly mentioned frequently occur.

⁴ Oats are the only crops expressly
mentioned in the regards, for which the
tenants accounted at the rate 01 sixpence
an acre. Barley is never mentioned. If

it was sown at all in assarts, it was prob-
ably included in the general word ⁴ trame-
sium’ or ⁴ trameys.'

In the Forest Assize of Rich. i., as
stated by Roget 01 Howden, the following
article occurs:

‘In rewardo, autem, foreste hec supra-
dicta uidenda sunt. Et uidenda sunt in
rewardo noua essarta et uetera inbladata
post ultimum rewardum et quo blado uel
legumine inbladata sint. Noua, autem,

inbladata sunt de frumento uel siligine,
unaqueque acra dabit regi duodecim de-
narios de illa uestitura; et si inbladata
