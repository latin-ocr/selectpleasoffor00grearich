THE CLERGY xoi

justices would deliver him to the ordinary as a clerk convicted of a
trespass against the forest laws. It also appears that the justices
refused to allow the pecuniary penalty to be assessed by the bishops
in their courts. The punishment of a poaching clerk was considered
to be as much a matter for the king as his trial.

The clergy also enjoyed an immunity from the necessity of finding
pledges for their appearance at the forest eyre when accused of
offences against the venison. Sometimes it is stated in the record
that a man was not attached because he was a clerk. Of this we have
an example¹ from the Northampton eyre of 1253.

Presentatum est per forestarios et uiridarios quod die 2 Martis proxima
post festum sancti Gregorii anno tricesimo octauo quod Willelmus Belayys
homo Walteri de Rudham persone de Treng’ occidit quendam ceruum in
bosco de Blysewurth' quem ceruum idem Walterus habuit. . . . Et Walterus
de Rudham non uenit nec fuit attachiatus quia clericus ; ideo mandatum est
episcopo Linc’ quod faciat eum uenire etc.

Ἴ On the other hand, it seems clear that the clergy were, in fact,
liable to arrest, when found in the act of trespassing· in the
forest, although they did not admit liability. Thus in the year 1251
the foresters of Weybridge arrested 3 a servant of John of Crakehall,
who was found trespassing in the forest by night. The vicar of
Huntingdon and a servant of the bishop of Lincoln demanded that he
should be delivered from prison and restored to Holy Church. They
threatened to excommunicate the foresters and then went to the
prison and dragged out the offending clerk. At the eyre the vicar
was ordered to appear before the justices and was delivered as one
convicted of these facts to the archdeacon of Huntingdon, who was
probably attending the court as the attorney of the bishop for the pur-
pose of receiving clerks. The servant of John of Crakehall was also
delivered to the archdeacon as one convicted of manifest evil doing to
the venison‚ while John himself, who a few years later was Treasurer
of England, was amerced ten marks for harbouring him after his
evil deeds.

Again, in January 1253 a clerk ‘¹ was found trespassing by night in
the forest of Rockingham. The foresters demanded gage and pledge
of him, but according to the record he could not find pledges to them.
This was only another way of recording that he claimed his clerical
privilege. Nevertheless the foresters arrested him, but he managed
to escape from their custody. The record is unfortunately damaged‚
