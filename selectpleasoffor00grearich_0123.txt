THE CHASE, THE PARK Δ11111) Tun WARREN 'cxv' ’

forest and beasts of the chase, the various beasts which were hunted
were divided into two principal classes by sportsrnen. A hunter who
lived in the reign of Edward II. and at a later date became known as
Twici‚¹ wrote a little tract² in French on the art of hunting. In it
he states that the hart, the wolf, the boar and the hare are hunted
in one way, and the buck, the doe, the 1οΧ and all other vermin in
another. Manwood’s classification of beasts of the forest and beasts
of the chase was based upon Twici’s tract and not upon any con-
sideration of the laws affecting them. The material words of the
tract on this subject are as follows :

Le lefre . . . .; il est enchase‚ e 16 cerf ausi est enchace e le lou e 16
sengler. Et vous, sire veneour, dites moy quantes des bestes sunt aquilliz.
Le deym e la deyme e le gopil e la gopille e tote autre vermine. Ore vodroi
ioe savoir quantez des bestes sunt menz de lymer e quanz de bestes sunt
trouez de bracheZ. Sire‚ touz ceaus qe sunt encIraces, sunt lneuz de lymer.
E touz ceaus enquillez sunt trovez de brac-hez.

It is probable, however, that the metliods of hunting which were
adopted in Twici's (lay were modified at a later date3 and that in the
time of Manwood there was 110 good reason 101· 1116 classification‚ even
for purposes of sport.

The word ‘ chase ’ was sometimes used in other senses than that
ofaprivate forest. Thus in some letters3 close of 10 January,
1226Ί the sheriff 16 directed to 611111111011 those who have enjoyed
chase: that is to say, an acquittance or some liberty belonging to
forest. At other times it seems to have denoted a portion of the
forest in which the inhabitants had no customary right of common.

The word ⁴ park ’ was applied to a district of land enclosed with a
paling. There is no reason for supposing that it was used exclusively
of enclosures made for the purpose of preserving beastsferae naturae.
