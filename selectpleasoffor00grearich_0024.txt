Thus Henry ΠΙ. appointedl Roger of Lancaster deputy for Roger of
Leyburn, the justice of the forest north of the Trent, by letters patent
dated the 25th October 1265, during the pleasure of the king and
Roger of Leyburn himself.

The justices ² were usually nien of considerable political standing.
John 3 fitz-Geoffrey, Robert Passelewe and Robert Waleiand, for
example, all left their mark on English history, independently ot'
their administration of forest business. By the end of the fourteenth
century the office evidently became a sinecure, being then usually
held by a nobleman of high rank. But though a sinecure, the
income attached to it was certainly not derived solely from an official
salary, for from the close of the thirteenth century the justices of the
forest south of the T rent received froin the king an annual payment ⁴
of a hundred pounds only; and the salary of the justices of the forest
north of the Trent was only two-thirds of that suni.

'I‘he Wardens.

Next in authority to the justices were the wal-dens of the forest.
They were variously described in official docuinentS, and seldom
expressly as wardens; but the word may conveniently be used to
avoid ambiguity. Usually a warden had the custody of a single
forest, but in some cases he had the charge of a group of forests
lying apart from one another. Thus in the year 1300 Sabine

¹ Roger of Leyburn was appointed jus-
tice ot' the forest north of ilie Trent by
letters patent dated 25 October 1265. (See
Patent Roll 232, ln. 3.) On the sanie day
Roget of Lancaster was appointed his
deputy. (See sanie roll, m. 2.) In the
letters patentdated 1 August 1270 by which
Geoffrey de Neville was appointed justice
of the forest north of the Trent, Roger of
Lancaster is described as steward of the
forest (see Fine Roll 67, ln. 5).

² A complete list of justices of the
forest south of the Trent, with the dates of
the letters patent appointing them, will be
published in one of the forthcoming
numbers of the anqhssslz Historical Reriew.

³ The appointments ot John fitz-
Geoffrey and Bobert Passelewe are not
recorded upon the Patent Rolls. Robert
Walerand was appointed ‘ steward’ of the
king's forest south of the Trent by letters
patent dated 1 September 1256. (See
Patent Roll 67, m. 3.) Nevertheless the
same letters patent direct the ministers of
the forest to be intendent and respondent

to him as to a justice of the forest. He is
the only justice who is described as steward
in letters patent of appoiutlnent. In other
documents he is described as ‘justice of the
forest)

‘⁸ Roger l'Estrange, who was appointed
justice of the forest south of the Trent by
letters patent dated 21 October 1283 (see
Patent Roll⁷ 101 m. 5), received an annual
fee of 1005. (See Liberate Rolls 542, 543,
544 and 545.)

Geot’frey de Neville, who was appointed
justice of the forest north of the Trent by
letters patent dated 1 August 1270 (see
Fine Roll 67, m. 5), received an annual fec
ot one hundred marks. (See Liberate Roll,
537, m. 3.)

The letters patent appointing a justice
usually state that he is to take the same
salary as his predecessors in the office.
