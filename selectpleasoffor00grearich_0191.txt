JIUNTINGDON Erfflc, An. 1255 21

a certain Norman his page and he himself were evil-doers to the
venison of the lord king, and that Norman Sampson sold three oaks
in Weybridge, and committed many other trespasses while he was a
forester; therefore an order is sent to the sheriff of Warwick etc. to
have etc. at Northainpton etc. on the octave of St. John the Baptist
etc. And that the same sheriff eto. why he had him not etc. at

Huntingdon etc. on the octave of St. Barnabas the Apostle asetc.
Afterwards Norman Sampson came to Northampton and made fine
by two marks by the pledge of Henry of Ludbrook and Eustace of

Watford, who have lands in the county of N orthampton.

As yet of the venison.

A certain fawn was found in the wood of Brampton wounded with
a certain arrow. An inquisition was made, and the townships know
nothing. And because the townships of Bmmpton, Ellington,
Grafham and Dillington did not come fully, therefore they are in
mercy.

It was presented by the foresters and verderers that a certain
buck and one haunch of venison and a greyhound were found in the
house of master Hen1·y then the rector of the school of Huntingdon.
And this Henry and Robert his undermaster for suspicion of the said
venison were taken and delivered to Philip of Stanton then the sheriff
of Huntingdon; and of his delivery nothing at present. And it is
proved by the verderers that the aforesaid Robert was an overt evil
doer to the venison with greyhounds 3 and that he was harboured in
the house of the aforesaid Henry, who was privy to his evil deeds to
the venison, and because they are clerks and have not a lay fee by
which they can be distrained, and R. of good memory then bishop of
Lincoln. . . .

It was presented by the foresters and verderers that Ralph of
Holcot a clerk was journeying towards Huntingdon with a page who led
greyhounds. And they escaped from his hands and brought down a
fawn of a year old. And when Richard Lenveyse the forester, being
near, saw this, he took the said Ralph and his page and the greyhounds 3
