THE FOREsT EYRE lxix

have related, for the most part, to the acts of the forest Officers. There
were no recognised headings, corresponding to ‘ Pleas of Venison ’ and
‘ Pleas of the Vert ' to describe the answers, but in the forest of Rutland
they are entituled ‘concerning1 the extortions of Peter de Neville‚’
and similar words of description occur in the eyre rolls of other forests.
These, however, were informal descriptione, which were followed by
enti-ies relating not only to extortions but to other matters, such as
the title 2 of the hereditary warden and foresters in fee to their baili-
wicks, and the number of riding and walking foresters in the forest.
One of the interrogatories seems to have asked for the metes 3 and
bounds of the forest, for on many of the eyre rolls of the counties
visited by Roger of Clifford the boundaries are recorded.

No general inquiries of this kind were made by William le Breton
in 1255, or by Alan la Zouche in 1262, when they and their fellows
were justices in eyre3 but others of similar nature were made in the
eyres of the reign of Edward Ι. The inquiries ‘¹ probably varied from
cyre to eyre. Their actual form survives in no official document, and
the answers were in general enrolled only when they led to some pecu-
niary profit to the king. In various unofficial documents, however,
there are copies of such articles of inquiry. Perhaps the best known
of them occur in the mediaeval law treatise ⁵ known as Fleta, which is
considered to have been written about the year 1290. They are there
styled ‘ Uetera capitula de forestis' and consist of fifty—one chapters.
Of these, the first eleven constitute another series of articles called the
Chapters ‘3 of the Regard, and ought not to be joined to the remaining
forty, which are interrogatories of the nature just described. These
forty chapters probably represent inquiries used by the forest justices
in eyre about the middle of the reign of Edward I.

the Cumberland eyre of 13 Ed. i. are
arranged in nineteen paragraphs. The
first words of each interrogatory are stated
immediately before each answer, thus ε
