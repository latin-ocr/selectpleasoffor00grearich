THE Fortnsr Erus lxi

It was the usual practice1 for the first enrohnent to begin
with some such words as, ‘It is presented by the foresters and
verderers, to wit . . . and proved3‘ while the first words of subse-
quent enrolments were, ‘It is presented and proved by the same
persons.’ Apparently they mean that the presentment was made by
the foresters and verderers in the forest eyre, and that the fact was
proved by the production of the record of a special inquisition. We
may search in vain for any signs of a jury 2 at the forest eyre. Some—
times, indeed, the townships3 were required to come before the justices
so that they might certify them of the fact found by them in the inqui-
sition; but there is nothing in the eyre roHs, which can lead us to
suppose tha-t in ordinary cases they were consulted by the court.
The record of the inquisition seems to have been considered a satis-
factory proof of the facts which it contained, without the aid of
further evidence.

If the forest officers made a pre'sentment which was inconsistent
with their records, they were either imprisoned or amerced according
to the gravity of their offence. An example⁴ of a verderer being
imprisoned occurred in the N orthampton eyre of 1255, when it was
presented and proved that a certain ‘beast' was taken beneath the
hedge of the castle of Rockingham by the men of the parson of
Easton. The word ‘ beast ’ is vague, but it can hardly be doubted
that it meant ‘beast of the forest.’ Yet one of the verdererS, John
Lovet contradicted his roll, by saying that the beast which was taken
was a certain sheep, and on being convicted of this by the verderers,
foresters and his other follows, was sent to prison. Probably the
justices asked him to explain the word ‘ beast' and he gave a false
explanation with a view to screening a friend or avoiding censure for

presentment of the foresters, on the ground
that the former could only e‘nrol what the
latter had presented to them. In the
Pickering eyre of 8 Ed. iii. the introductory

¹ It is difficult to say precisely what
was the procedure followed in the matter
of presentments at the forest eyre. On
p. 22 below, it is stated that the verderers

ought not to enrol anything in their rolls
except a presentment of the foresters. It
seems clear, however, notwithstanding this
statement, that they might enrol inquisi-
tions. The presentments appear to have
been entered on the rolls, as memoranda:
that is to say, they were not expressed to be
presentments. See, for example, the case
on p. 83. In such cases there seems to
have been no inquisition or trial to which
the word ‘conuictum’ can refer. It is a
matter of doubt whether the foresters and
verderers made their presentments jointly
or severally. It may even be the case that
the presentment of the verderers was the

‘Presentatum est per predictos forestarios
et conuictum per uiridarios ⁷ (Duchy of
Lancaster Miscellaneous Book, No. 1 fo.
203· r0.) See also the following note.

2 At the Pickering eyre of 8 Ed. iii.
the introductory words to the pleas of the
venison in some of the wards are as follows :

‘ Presentatum est per forestarios et duo-
decim iuratores warde predicte et conuictum
per uiridarios.’ (Duchy of Lancaster Mis-
cellaneous Book, No. 1, fo. 102 r0, 104 νῦ.)
The mention of jurors in this case is quite
exceptional.
