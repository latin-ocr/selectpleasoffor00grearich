saluus (M. F. fauve), fallow. In the

forest rolls this word is frequently used
of greyhounds and other dogs. It was
also used of horses. In a roll of forest
inquisitions of 19 to 21 Ed. i. (For.
Proc„ Tr. of Rea, 82), we also have
‘iumentum fanum! The forms ‘faus’
(p. 96), ‘fauw ’ and ‘fauwe‚’ are also
found occasionally, the last two occur-
ring in the Nottingham eyre roll of
8 Ed. iii. (For. Proc.‚ Tr. of Rea, 132,
Roll 6). The compound adjectives
‘ faus uestitus’ (p. 96) and ‘saluus
ruffus' (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rec„ 127,
Roll 6) deserve notice.

fermisona‚ the season of hunting the

hind and the doe. It extended from
11 November to 2 February. The fol-

lowing is an extract from a fine levied
at Lichfield on 3 February 1245:

Capere in predicto parco unam damam
in fermisona inter festum sancti Martini

et Purificacionem beate Marie (Feci of

Fines, Stafford‚ Fz'le 5, No. 28).

In some letters close of 6 October
1310 we have:

cum mittamus dilectum uallettum . . .
ad capiendum . . . quadraginta damas
de instanti seisona fermesonis (Close
Roll 133, m. 21).

An undated document, a chirograph
between William, ear] de Warenne, and
John of Thornhill, contains the follow-
ing:

Idem comes concessit eidem Iohanni
et heredibus suis libere capere per
annum quinque ceruos de pinguedine et
quinque bissas in fermisione (Aneient
Deecls, A. 317).

Another form of the same word was
⁴ sermacio ' (see For. Proc. Tr. of Hecu,
553, m. 4).

See also pinguedo.

feto (M. F. saon), a fawn. “Fhoom'

⁴ feon' and ⁴ faon‚' all treated as nouus
of the third declension, are forms of
this word. It is used of both sexes:

octo faones masculi et duodecim
femelle (Close Roll 61, m. 6).

It is also used of the red and fallow
deer alike: thus, ‘feto dami’ (p 82
above), and ‘cum feonibus bisse' (p. 62
above). Also:

uiginti et quatuor feones, uidelicet
medietatem bissarum et aliam medieta-
tem damarum (Close Roll 142, m. 19).

Apparently it is not necessarily a beast
of less than a year old, for we have the
expression ‘feto unius anni ' (p. 106
above)

fleck (M. F. fleche), a fletch. This word

seems to have denoted a particular
part of an arrow. Thus we have ‘duas
sagittas barbatas sine fleck’ (pp. 94, 95),
which are also described as ⁴ due sagitte
fracte! The fletch would be the wooden
part of the arrow, on which the metal
head and the feathers were fixed. In
the Huntinqdon Feet of Fines, File 11,
No. 220, we have the words ‘ una
fieccha pennata.' Perhaps a dart with-
out a metal head was called a fletch.
The passages in which arrows are
mentioned in this volume are collected
together under the word walisoa below.

fusta (p. 80). This word seems to have

been applied to trees generally. It was
not applied exclusively either to timber
trees or to trees expressly grown for
fuel, 01· which had become only fit
for fuel.

Uiginti fusta ad maeremium cum

omnibus coperonibus et escaetis suis
ad operaciones (Closs ΒΘΗ 65, m. 20).

Quadraginta fusta . . . ad trabes et
gistas (Rot. Lz'tt. Glaus. i. p. 595).

Duo fusta ad buscam inde faciendam
(Rot. Lz'tt. Claus. ii. p. 64).

That the word was applied to trees
grown for fuel is also evident from the
fact that ‘robora’ (the word usually
applied to such trees) were sometimes
referred to as ⁴ fusta‚’ thus :

Meminimus nos alias dedisse fratri
R. quondam abbati de S. decem uetera
robora non ferentia fructum uel folia . . .
ad focum suum que nec dictus abbasnec
