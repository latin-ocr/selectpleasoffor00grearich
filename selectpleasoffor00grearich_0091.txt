THE REGARD lxxxiii

marleram fossatum uel terram arabilem extra cooperatum in terra arabili
ita quod non sit ad nocumentum alicuius uicini.

Thus, certain acts, such as the erectiori of a mill, which had
hitherto been accounted purprestures‚ in whatever part of the forest
they were committed, could henceforth be committed with impunity
outside the covert by the owner of a land or woods within the forest.
If, however, the owner or anyone else enclosed the land with a hedge
and ditch, he was guilty of a purpresture, notwithstanding the
Charter of the Forest. ’

Tenants of woods within the forest had the right of cutting wood
for fuel and the repair of their property. The precise extent of the
right and the mode in which it was exercised probably varied in
different forests. It is probable that in some forests they were
allowed to lop trees, subject to the supervision of the forest Officers,
while in others they were allowed to take underwood and even fully-
grown trees other than oaks. But whatever the nature of the right
was, any abuse of it was recorded by the regarders in their rolls as
waste. In the eyre rolls the entries relating to wastes made since
the last eyre are styled ‘ The New Wastes‚' and form one of the chief
features of the enrolment of the regard. They vary in form, but the
following are specimen entries ¹ ι

De nouis uastis hoscorum.

Boscus Felicie de Radeford’ de Lenche Randholf‚ quem ipsa tenet nomine
dotis, uastatur de ueteri, et iterum de nouo per eandem ; ideo ipsa in
misericordia. Boscus capiatur in manum domini regis. De eadem Felicia
pro misericordia et quod rehabeat boscum suum dimidia marca.

Boscus Willelmi de Bello Campo de Alencestere uastatur de ueteri, et
iterum omnino deuastatur per eundem Walterum de nouo, et per Robertum
le Loue, qui fuit seruiens eiusdem Walteri apud Alencestr'‚ et per Rogerum
Careman et Willelmum Daybond, qui fuerunt wodewardi eiusdem bosci per
eorum uendiciones et dona; et ipsi wodewardi dederunt unam carettatam
busco pro duabus carettatis extraendis; ideo idem ipsi in misericordia et
bosci capiantur in manum domini regis. De predicto Waltero pro miseri—
cordia quinque marce.

Et abbas Alecestr’ uenit et clamat habere estoueria sua in eodem bosco,
uidelicet, unam carettatam busce 2 uno equo. Et ostendit cartas regis Henrici
de confirmacione et dominorum feodi qui fuerunt antiquitus de donacione.
Ideo consideratum est et preceptum quod forestarii domini regis faciant ipsi
abbati liberatam in eodem bosco de cetero in forma predicta.
