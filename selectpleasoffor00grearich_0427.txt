GLossARY 147

Clazcs. i. 173). In the Botulus Misae
of 14 John a certain hunter is called in
one place Thomas de Porkerez and in
another Thomas de Porkereciis (Coles‚
Documents, p. 253).

priketus‚ a pricket. The pricket is fre-

quently mentioned in the Nottingham
forest eyre rolls of 15 Ed. i. (For. Pron„
Tr. of Rec. No. 127), and although the
words ‘priketus dami’ and ‘priketus
dame’ often occur in them, they con-
tain no instances of the words ⁴ priketus
cerui' or ‘priketus bisse.’ From this
it would appear that the word from an
early date was usually applied to the
fallow deer only. There, are, however,
instances to the contrary. Thus, in
the Nottingham eyre 10115 of 8 Ed. iii.‚
we have 1115 expression ‘prickettus
cerui ’ (For Proc.‚ Tr. os Rec„ No. 132,
Rozz 6 d). Manwood uses it of a buck
of two years old. It should be noticed
that in a roll of inquisitions (p. 92
above) of 34 10 39 Η511. 111., 1115 word
is spelt ‘pricard,⁷ and this may be an
older form.

rogardator, a regarder. It should be

noticed that in 1115 forest pleas of 1115
reign of John, the form ‘regardor’ is
used. So 100 111 the Charter of the
Forest we have ‘reguardores.' The
earlier form was no longer in use in
the thirtieth year of Hen. iii.

retropannagium (pp. 67, 124), after-pan-

’ nage: that is to say, money paid by

way of pannage for the agistment of
pigs in the king's demesne woods after
the termination of the ordinary pannage
seasou. Usually a halfpenny a pig was
paid for after-pannage :

Dicunt quod idem Ι. habet retro-
pannagium, ita, scilicet, quod quando
dominus rex die sancti Martini accipit
pannagium suum, omnes illi qui porcos
suos habere noluerint ultra illum diem
sicut prius fuerunt in dominicis boscis

dabunt pro quolibet porco (1101010155-
tario unum obolum (Rot. Humi. i. p. 26).

robur, probably a pollard tree of any
kind, but perhaps also a tree stunted
by nature and not fit for timber. In
the thirteenth century the king sent
frequently letters close to the wardens
of his forests directing them to cause

divers people to have trees ; they were
usually described as ‘quercus⁷ or
‘ robora.' In the letters close the word
‘quercus’ was generally followed by
the words ‘ ad meremium‚’and ‘ robora'
nearly always by ‘ad focum suum.'
This shows that the ‘ robora' were fit
for fuel rather than timber. The word
was used of oaks, for the expression
‘robora quercus’ is not uncommon.
It was also used of beeches, for we have
the expression ‘robora fagorum' in a
forest inquisition held at Clarendon in
35 Ed. iii. (see For. Proc.‚ Tr. of Rea..
No. 310, skin 10) ς and other instances
of the same expression could be cited.
Moreover, in an account of a sale of
wood made in the year 29 Ed. i.‚ we
have a long list of ‘robora' and six
‘stubbs’ and their prices, and at the
end of it the words ⁶ Summa quercuum
et fagorum uenditarum ' (Accounts,
Eaech. Q. R„ Bundle 147, No. 10). The
six stubbs were sold for 33. 4d. In some
letters close dated 25 March 1278 the
words ‘robora castenearum’ are men-
tioned (Close Rozz 100, m. 11). These
facts show that the word ‘ robur ’ was
not applied 10 11555 of a particular
species, but to those of a particular
growth or condition.

The king's gifts of ‘robora‘ were
often limited to trees in a particular
state, thus:

quadraginta uetera robora . . . . ad
duos rogos (Rot. Lz‘tt. Claus. ii. 19, b).
duo robora folia non ferentia (ibid.
92, b, 93, b).
duo robora sicca folia non ferentia
(ibid. 119, b).
These and many similar entries show
that the word was used of trees which
were, often, old, dry and leafless‚ 5 fro.-
quent condition of pollard trees. A
passage which deserves special notice
is as follows :
buscam tam de subbosco quam de
ueteribus roboribus cum frondibus et

aliis escaetis suis ad duos rogos facien-
das (Glose Rozl 65, m. 6).

111 111051 forests when the king gave a,
tree to anybody the crop or top and lop,
which were described sometimes by the
Latin words ‘ coporones et escaeta ’ and
at others by ‘coporoncs ' only, belonged
