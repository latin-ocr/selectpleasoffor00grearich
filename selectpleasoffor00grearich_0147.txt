forestarius eques et duo forestarii pedes sumptibus domini regis usque ad
ultimam itineraeionem Iohannis Byset, iusticiarii domini Henriei regis patris
domini Edwardi qui nunc est de foresta. Et post dictam itineracionem
uixerunt et adhuc uiuunt super patriam, et colligunt blada et garbas et alia ;
et faciunt tabernas contra cartam de libertatibus foreste,

It is clear that it was to the advantage of the inhabitants of a
forest to have foresters in fee among them. For they usually received
certain rights and profits with their bailiwicks, and so had means of
living upon the king instead of upon the country. In the first year
of John the knights of Staffordshire gave the king forty marks and a
palfrey for having their liberties of the forest as they had them in the
time of Henry 11„ so that other foresters might not be put there,
unless they were enfeoffed of their bailiwicks.1

Eyre Bous—There are no eyre rolls at the Public Record Office
of an earlier date than 39 Hen. 111„ except a few fragments of rolls
of the year 10 John, most of which are printed in this volume. It
will be noticed that the nature and style of the rolls of the reign of
John are different from those of the reign of Henry ΠΙ.

Park.—In the tract known as ‘ La Court de Baron‚’ there is a
precedent ² of a case of chasing beasts in the lord’s park. In his
‘ count ’ the parker alleged that the trespass was made in a franchise
which the lord had from the king, to wit, of having the park for his
own proper warren as was contained in the chartei· which he had
from the king, whereby it was forbidden on pain of forfeiture of 101.
that any should enter to chase or take beasts unless by the lord’s
leave. These words suggest that it was usual for the king to grant
charters of imparkment with a penal clause similar to the one
invariably inserted in charters of warren. The Charter Rolls show
that this was not the case, and it is therefore probable that the words
which are the subject of this note, if they are part of the tract as
originally written, are erroneous.

Warren.-—In an unprinted Year Book, which will be published in
due course by the Selden Society, there is a case which seems to
show that in the reign of Edward 11„ the lord might amerce tres-
passers in his warren, provided that the amount of the amercement
did not exceed the value of the beast taken by the trespasser. The
case is one which was heard in the Kent eyre for pleas of the crown
and common pleas in 6 Ed. II.
