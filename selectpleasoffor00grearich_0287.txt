INQUISITIONS CONCERNING THE VENISON IN THE
FOREST OF ESSEX.

On the Sunday next after the feast of st. Osithe ³ in the twenty-
second year of the reign of king Henry Simon the son of Norman
was going through his bailiwick of Kingswood‚ and he saw there full
sixteen men on foot and two on horseback with bows and arrows;
and as soon as ever he saw them he raised the cry upon them. And
immediately afterwards the two men on horseback came, and assaulted
him and beat him, and wounded him. And afterwards the aforesaid
sixteen men on foot came and took away from him his horn and his
sword, his bit and his surcingle. And when the aforesaid Simon had
escaped from their hands he went to seek the verderers3 and im-
mediately⁴ they came with men of the neighbourhood and sought
those aforesaid men in the aforesaid forest, and they could not find
them. And afterwards the foresters and verderers assembled for the
purpose of better certifying the justices of the forest on their coming.
And they made an inquisition by four townships‚ to wit, Dedham‚
Boxsted, Ardleigh‚ and Langham, who say that at present they know
nothing ; but they will use great diligence in inquiring into this.
