Justice in cyre of the Forest, commonly called the justice seat.⁷ In
modern English, when we speak of a court ¹ we usually mean a judicial
session either for the purpose of deciding some issue in fact or in
law, or for the purpose of conducting some preliminary inquiry, such
as a coroner’s inquest, upon which further judicial proceedings may
take place. On the other hand, in the middle ages, or at any rate in
the thirteenth century, the Latin word ‘ curia' which represented the
word ‘ court’ was seldom required for this purpose. The county
court was called ⁴ comitatus ' or the county ; the hundred court
‘ hundredum ’ or the hundred 3 and similarly the court which Manwood
called the court of attachments was called simply ‘attachiamentum'
or the attachment. Manwood was probably aware of this usage, so
when he read in the Charter of the For-est that ‘ suanimota' or
swanimotes were to be held three times a year only, he thought that
the word ‘suanimota' meant a court sitting for the administration of
some particular branch of the forest law. The words of the Charter
were as follows :

Nullum suanimotum de cetero teneatur in regno nostro nisi ter in anno;
uidelicet in principio quindecim dierum ante festum sancti Michaelis, quando
agistatores conueniunt ad agistandum dominicos boscos nostros; et circa
festum sancti Martini quando agistatores nostri debent recipere pannagium
nostrum ; et ad ista duo suanimota conueniant forestarii, uiridarii‚ et agista-
tores et nullus alius per districcionem; et tercium suanimotum tenea-tur in
inicio quindecim dierum ante festum sancti Iohannis Baptista pro feonacione
bestiarum nostrarum ; et ad istud suanimotum tenendum conueniant
forestarii et uiridarii et nulli alii per districcionem. Et preterea singulis
quadraginta diebus per totum annum conuenient uiridarii et forestarii ad
uidendum attachiamenta de foresta, tam de uiridi, quam (le uenacione, per
presentacionem ipsorum forestariorum, et coram ipsis attachiatiS. Predicta
autem suanimota non teneantur nisi in comitatibus in quibus teneri
consueuerunt.

It may well be argued that the word ‘suanimotum' was intended ὴ
to apply to a court with some particular jurisdiction ; but on the other
hand such an interpretation is not necessary. The article is quite

¹ It was used rather with reference to the
person entitled to the profits of judicia]
proeeedings than to their subject matter or
the persons before whom they were held.
Fines were made ‘in the court of the lord
king ⁷ but ⁴ before his justices.' Expressions
such as ‘ the court of the bench ' were not in
official use in the thirteenth century. The
word ⁴ bench ⁷ was sufficient to describe the
court. On the other hand, in metior eom-ts

the word ‘ curia ’ was used to describe both
the judicial session and also the persons
who made presentlnents, even in the reign
of Hen. iii. As to this see Samen Societgs
Pubkicastons, vol. i. Again, in an ordin-
ance of 11 October 1234 relating to the
Sheriff‘s Toum the words ‘ curie magnatum
Anglie ' occur (see Statutes of the ReaZm, i.
118; Annales Monastz'ci, Dn‘nstaplia, Bous
Series, vol. iii. p. 139).
