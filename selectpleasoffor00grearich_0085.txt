concerned with the herbage in the king’s demesnes, another with eyries
of hawks and falcons in the forest, a third with forges and mines, a
fourth with harbours from which timber could be exported‚ and a
fifth with honey in the forest. To these five chapters there are often
iio-answers recorded in the regards enrolled upon the eyre rolls. In
most of the forests there were no seaports; and in many of them
there were neither forges nor mines. If the king’s demesnes were
well kept, andis his rights with respect to the eyries of hawks and
falcons and to honey in the forest had not been infringed, there would
in general be no need for any enrolment about these matters.

The chapters which were considered to be of real importance
related to assarts, purprestures and waste, offences which yielded a
considerable revenue at every eyre. Each chapter contained several
questions. The first one was as follows :

The assarts made in the forest after the beginning of the second year
of the first coronation of Henry III. are to be viewed, and 10 be estimated
by the number of acres. And it is to be inquired who made them, and who
now holds the1n; and with what corn they have been sown. And if they
shall not now be sown it 18 10 be inquired with what corn they were sown
after the beginning of the second year of the first coronation of the afore-
said king or after the last regard made after the aforesaid time. And the
sowing of the winter corn ¹ 18 10 be written by itself, and the sowing of the
spring corn by itself. And it is to be inquired of whose fee they are; and
to what town they belong. And the assarts which were made before the
last regard made after the beginning of the second year of the coronation
of the aforesaid king are to be written by themselves; and those which
were made afterwards by themselves.

Two series of questions relating to purprestures of different kinds,
and another relating to wastes, were chapters of the regard closely
resembling in form the chapter relating to assartS. Os: the three
remaining Chapters one directed a view to be made of the king’s
deniesne woods‚ and an inquiry whether the underwood and branches
in them had been impaired. Another ordered that all purprestures,
assarts and wastes in the king’s demesnes should be viewed and in-
breviated in the same manner as before the Charter of the Forest.
The last declared that the regarders were to inquire Who had bows or
arrows, crossbows‚ braches or greyhounds, or anything else for doing
harm to the king’s deer.

But instead of enrolling the answers of the regarders one by one
