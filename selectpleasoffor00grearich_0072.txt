be no amercement; and consequently the fact 01 1110 imprisonment
would not be recorded.

If the trespasser had never been attached or, having been attached,
failed to appear before the justices in eyre‚ there were two modes of
proceeding. Either the sheriff 01 1110 county in which he lived or had
property was ordered to cause him to appear 3 or if he could not be
found and had no property by which he could be distrained, the
justices directed him to be exacted in the county court, and if 110
1011οᾶ 10 appear in due course, he was outlawed. If, however, the
trespasser was a beneficed clerk who had no lay fee, the order was
sent 10 1110 bishop of his diocese, instead 01 10 1110 sheriff, but if
he had no benefice he was exacted and outlawed as if he were 0
layman. When 1110 trespasser appeared, if the presentment of the
verderers was in proper form, 1110 justices almost invariably
adjudged that he be sent 10 prison. But just as he might already
have been imprisoned in order 10 0001110 1110 appearance before the
justices, so now he was imprisoned not so much by way of punishment
as for the purpose 01 securing payment 01 0 fine for his ransom.
In the eyre 01 William le Breton, the record usually states that
the trespasser ‘comes¹ and is detained in prison.’ In some cases
nothing more is said of him, but in others the record continues, ,
‘ Afterwards he came and made fine by so many marks or shillings.'
In subsequent eyres, in place of the last entry we usually have,²
‘Afterwards the aforesaid . . . being brought out of prison, made
fine by so much money.' Even where the enrolment of a plea ends
with the wordS, ‘he is detained in prison‚' there is generally evidence
that a fine was paid. Thus, although the pleas of the venison only
inform us of the imprisonment 3 of John Lovet for the false statement
which we have already noticed, and say nothing of any fine for his
release, yet the list of amercements ⁴¹ and fines on another roll 01 1110
001110 file 01 eyre rolls shows that he made fine by twelve marks for
his mendacity and concealment. In several other instances the same
1101 supplements the deficiencies in this respect of the enrolment of
the pleas of the venison. It would seem that the clerk began enrolling

¹ A difficulty in translating may con-
veniently be noticed here. In some rolls the
expression, ⁴ modo non ueniunt ⁵ 10 used 3 in
others ‘modo non uenerunt.' Frequently,
however, the verb is not extended and its
first three letters only are written, so that
it is difficult to say whether ‘ ueniunt ’ 01
⁴ uenerunt' is intended. It is also often
impossible to say whether ‘uenit’ repre-
sents the present 01 the perfect tense. In

some cases the intention 01 1110 scribe can
be gathered from other passages on the
same roll, but often no such assistance is
to be obtained.

as follows 2 ⁴ De Iohanne Louet, uiridario,
