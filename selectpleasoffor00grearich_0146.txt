ADDITIONAL NOTES.

The Forata—In the reign of John, the chief barons of the realm
were considered to have a certain interest in the royal foreste. This
is apparent from the following entry 1 on the roll of letters close of the
eighth year of his reign :

Rex Brieno de Insula etc„ Sciatis quod bene uolumus quod capitales
barones nostri, unde nobis mandasti, transeuntes per balliuam uestram feras
capiant, set ita quod sciatis qui illi fuerint et quid capiant et quantum, quia
non habemus forestas et bestias nostras ad opus nostrum tantum, set eciam
ad opus fidelium nostrorum, set bene illas custodire faciatis propter latrones

quia bestie magis expauent per latrones quam per predictos barones. . . .
Teste me ipso apud Wudestok’ undecimo die Iunii.

The right of the barons to take deer on passing through the for-ests
was admitted by the Charter of F orest of 1217.

The Assize of the ronst—It seems probable that the words ‘ assize
of the forest ’ meant merely the well-established custom of the forest.
In a writ ² dated 31 December 1222 the king stated that according to
the assize of the forest verderers ought not to be put in assizes, juries
or recognitions. In another writ‚3 dated 2 October 1224, he stated
that according to the law and custom of the forest verderers ought not
to be put therein. ’

The J ustices of the Forat—In the reign of Edward II. the justices
of the forest became known as chief wardens. The change is explained
by the following words in the New Ordinances ⁴¹ of the year 1311 :

Et desormes soit escrit a eux com as chiefs gardeins de la forest, pm· ce qe
Iustices ne deiuent il estre, ne record auoir forsque en Eyre.

The Foresters.—Where the working foresters were not paid by the
war-dens they were said to live upon the country. In 7 Edward I.
the following statement was made at an inquisition⁵ concerning
Gillingham forest :

Et sciendum est quod in predicta foresta consueuerunt esse forestarii,
scilicet, unus de feodo propriis sumptibus suis, et adhuc est; et unus
