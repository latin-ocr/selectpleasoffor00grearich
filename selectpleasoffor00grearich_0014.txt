Vl SELECT PLEAs OF THE FOREsT

Language in Owens College, Manchester, for advice about the
French text printed on pp. 125-128 ; Mr. R. B. Turton, of the Inner
Temple, who read the greater part of the text in proof, for many useful
suggestions3 Miss K. S. Martin for assistance in collating the text
and for the verification of most of the dates and references in the
book; and Miss E. Μ. Samson for compiling the Index of Matters.

The assistance of the Literary Director and the Hon. Secretary has
been invaluable ; and the latter has devoted more time and attention
to this volume than the Society or its editor could have hoped to
secure. During the unfortunate illness of the Literary Director,
Mr. C. E. H. Chadwyck Healey very kindly acted in his stead.

The labour of endeavouring to recover from the plea rolls a
branch of law of which little has been known for a long time past
has not been inconsiderable3 and the editor hopes that, if his efforts
have been successful, the delay that has thus been occasioned will
not be regretted by members of the Society. The volume should
have appeared in 1899, and represents that year in the Society’s
Publications.

July 1901.

Nora—In the king's Chancery of the
thirteenth century the letter v was used to
represent the initial letter u, even when the
initial had a vowel sound. Thus the clerks
of the Chancery wrote ‘vt‚' ‘vnum’ and
‘vnde' In the middle of a word they used
the letter u, even when it had a con—
sonantal sound. The clerks of the Ex-
chequer and the two Benches used the
letters u and v in the same fashion. Else-
where, however, the letter υ was occasion-
ally used in the middle of a word. This
was the case in the forest eyre rolls; and
as it is of some interest to notice how far

the spelling of the clerks who enrolled
forest proceedings differed from that of the
clerks of the Chancery‚ the exact use of the
letters u and v has been followed in the
text printed in this volume. As the docu-
ments quoted in the Introduction are short
and are derived from various sources, little
information ean be obtained from them
about the use of the letters u and v. For
this reason the letter u is printed in the
Latin documents quoted in the Introduc-
tion, even when it is represented in the
original by the letter v.
