and verderem, for all the evil doers seem to have been forest Officers
or their servants, and the verderers and foresters are not mentioned as
having taken part in the proceedings. The inquisition itself is im-
perfectly recorded. After a series of statements made by the jurors,
there comes another list¹ of thirteen jurors, who make further state-
ments, two ² of which are to the same effect as others already made by
the first jurors. There are no introductory or marginal words which
explain the object of the second jury, but it is possible that some words
have been carelessly omitted and that the enrolment really represents
two separate inquisitions held before Sir Arnold de Bois.

On the same roll there is another inquisition ³ which deserves notice.
It was made before the justice of the forest on 2Ο J anuary 125} by
the foresters and verderers, who made four statements‚ the first two
relate to particular trespasses, the third amplifies the second, and
the fourth declares that two persons are evil doers to the venison.
This inquisition was of a different character from the one held on
2 October 1253. It was made by the foresters and verderers and not
by thirteen jurors3 and it was concerned with matters which would
usually form the subject of special inquisitions. It bears a close
resemblance to the general inquisitions⁴¹ which came into use some
thirty years later.

There is an entry⁵ on the Northampton eyre roll of 1255, which
seems to referto some inquisitions similar to the one held before Sir
Arnold de Bois on 25 October 1253. It occurs among the pleas of the
venison, but its introductory words are not the usual ‘ it is presented
etc.‚’ but ‘ because it was found and enrolled in the roll of inquisitions
which Arnold de Bois, the justice of the forest, made in the bailiwick
of Stanion.’ The facts which were there found and enrolled do not
occur in the roll of the inquisitions 34 to 39 Henry HL, which we
possess 3 but as they refer to offences committed by Hugh of Golding-
ham, the steward of the forest, the explanation of their absence may
be, that the roll belonged to him and he refused to enrol any matters
reflecting upon himself.

There are also entries on the eyre rolls corresponding to the
inquisition held before Arnold de Bois on 20 Janua1·y 1253, but they
are ordinary presentments occul-ring among the pleas of the venison.
