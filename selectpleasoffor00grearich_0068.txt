The words ‘ pro plegio ' seem to have been used of the pledges who
failed to produce a trespasser at the forest eyre. Where a sum of
money 15 placed opposite a name and that name occurs again in the
list, the word ‘alibi ’ 15 placed after the name instead of a second sum,
and the first sum represents the total sum for which the trespasser
is liable for all his trespasses. Probably the word ⁶ Ramesia,' written
instead of a sum of money, means that the trespasser against whose
name it is placed was a tenant of the abbot of Ramsey, who made fine
at the eyre for all the trespasses of his tenants.‘²

'I'he Pleas of the Venison.

The forest eyre was chiefly concerned with fines and amercements
for breaches of the laws of the forest. It was almost as much a
financial assembly as a court of law. The records of its proceedings
are memoranda of sums of money owing to the king rather than
registers of process and judgments. For this reason the pleas of the
venison, which might be expected to throw some light on the manners
and customs of the English peasantry‚ are disappointing. In general
they record those facts only from which the king might dei-ive a fine
or an amercement. Often3 they tell us nothing of a trespass, except
the sum by which the trespasser made fine for his release from
prison. It is even difficult to deduce from the mass of common form
in which the pleas are recorded the nature of much of the ordinary
process adopted in the administration of the forest law.
