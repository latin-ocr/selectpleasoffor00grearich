THE FOREST EYRE lxiii
ment 01 the fourth township, Little Stukeley, which had not already
been amerced 101 not having come fully to some inquisition, is duly
recorded on the eyre roll.

The amercements 01 the townships varied considerably in severity.
At the Huntingdon eyre 01 1255 the township 01 Yaxley, which
is recordedl as having failed to come fully to an inquisition on
one occasion only, was amerced six marks. On the other hand,
Brampton, which failed in this way no less than six 2 times, was only
amerced two marks. The smallest amercements 101 a single default
were 01 half a mark ³ each.

On the file 01 the rolls 01 the Huntingdon eyre the amerce-
ments of trespassers against the venison were written above their
names as in the case 01 the townships. But on some files of eyre
rolls none 01 the amercements, whether 01 townships or 01 trespassers
to the venison‚ were interlineated in this way. For example, on the
101184 01 the Northampton eyre 01 1255 there is no interlineation 01
amercements among the pleas of the venison‚ but on one roll ⁵ of the
file there is a list 01 fines and amercements 101· trespasses against
the venison.

Just as the eyre rolls only inform us that a special inquisition has
been held when the townships which held it were amerced 101 not
coming fully, 80 they only inform us that a trespasser has been
imprisoned to secure his appearance at the forest eyre when some event
has happened which has given rise to an amercement. Thus the
record tells us 01 a trespasser being imprisoned when the 81101111 had
released him without an order6 from the king 01 the chief justice 01
the forest ; or when he had been delivered to pledges pursuant to such

'⁴ an order, and the pledges failed to produce him at the forest eyre. In

the one case the 81101111, 111 the other the pledgeS,⁷ would be amerced ;
and consequently the fact 01 the imprisonment and the Subsequent
default would be recorded. But if the sheriff had released his
prisoner to pledges upon the receipt of a proper mandate directing
him to do 80, and the pledges produced him at the eyre, there would

and-Woolley (p. 19).

printed in this volume.

⁶ See the case 01 Alan of Maidwell on
p. 28 below. The fact of the imprison-
ment also appears on the rolls when
there was any irregularity about the
delivery 01 the prisoner. See, for example,
the case 01 Henry de Colleville on p. 12
below, and the case 01 Simon 01 Houghton
on p. 14.
