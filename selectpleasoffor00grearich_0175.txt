came with his fellow chaplains and admonished them that they should
deliver the same Gervais from prison, and restore him to holy Church
on the ground that he was a clerk. And the foresters, fearing excom-
munication‚ permitted him to depart and did nothing else. And the
said Walter was told that he took out of prison and carried away the
aforesaid Gervais against the peace and by force. And, being asked
how he wished to aequit himself, he says that 110 11111 not answer in
this court; therefore the foresters and verderers are asked whether the
said Walter and the others carried away the same Gervais from prison
or whether the foresters, fearing 011 ecclesiastical sentence, of their
own will permitted him to depart. They say, that William of Leicester
and Walter and the others came to the foresters with books and
candles meaning to excommunicate them if they did not deliver the
aforesaid Gervais from prison, and they said that they had not power
to deliver him. And then William and the others went to the

year during the night, two greyhounds which were running through
