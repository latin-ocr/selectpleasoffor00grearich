enwarrened the lands of 1116 free tenants and kept them in defense so
that no one could hunt in them without his hounds being taken and
detained until 116 made satisfaction to the same Richard.¹ In all cases
where the lord protected his interests in this way there would, in
general, 106 110 forfeiture to the king. If a suit to replevy 1116 property
taken by the lord were brought in the king's court, the king’s officere
exacted a forfeiture when due.

It appears that the lord of a warren usually had a court of his
own, in which cases of trespass could be determined. Charters of
warren seem 10 have been for the most part granted 10 lords of
manors. It may, indeed, be doubted whether cases of trespass in
warrens were ever heard in the 0011116 of the hundred and the county.
.1f the lord had a court of his own, he naturally would 1101 6116 111 any
other court without some good reason. If he had no such court, he
would often be the tenant of some other lord who had a court in
which he could proceed against trespassers in 1116 warren. Un-
fortunately‚ the records of courts of hundreds and counties are rare,
and the mere absence of cases relating 10 warrens in 111066 records of
them which we have 16 1101 6 sufficient basis for a confident state-
ment that the hundred and county courts had no jurisdiction in
such cases.

In a few charters of warren it was expressly declared that no
person might enter the lands of the grantee to hunt or take the hare
and the 1οΧ or anything which to warren belonged. But in charters
made in the ordinary form no particular kinds of beasts were men-
tioned. It 16 abundantly clear, however, that a grant of warren did
not enable the grantee to prevent other people entering his warren in
pursuit of deer. There was 6 judicia] (1601610112 with regard to the
buck in Hilary term 1283. Philip of Willoughby brought an action
of trespass in the King's Bench against Thomas the warrener of the
abbot of st. Albans. He alleged that Thomas had assaulted his men
and seized his hounds and other goods. The defendant answered
that the plaintiff’s men were hunting in the abbot's warren and that
