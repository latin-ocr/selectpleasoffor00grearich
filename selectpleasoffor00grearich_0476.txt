These Rolls illustrate a department of the history of English law which is at present very dark.
The Justiciarii Judaeorum, who had the status of Barons of the Exchequer‚ exercised jurisdiction in‘
all affairs relating to the Jewish community, namely, in the accounts of the revenue, in pleas upon
contracts made between Jews and Christians‚ and in causes or questions touching their land or goods,
or their tallages, fines, and forfeitures.

The Records* of this Court consist of Bills‚Answe1-s, Deposstions, and other proceedings. They
are of great importance as illustrating both public and private history. None of the Orders or Decrees

that “the last notice of them that could be got was that they were in a house in St. Bartholomew's
close, London.⁷'
