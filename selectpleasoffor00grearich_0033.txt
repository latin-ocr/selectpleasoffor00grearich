THE FoREST OFFIFElts XXV
owner of a wood within a forest was obliged to have a forester, which,
far from being a hardship‚ was a convenience; but the foresten· ¹ was
bound to swear fealty to the king and his venison‚ and the vert. If
the owner of such a wood had no forester‚ or if he had a forestes
who had not taken the necessary cath, the wood was seised into the
King's hands. The forester was called a woodward. His lord was
bound to present him to the chief justice of the forest, before whom,
and none other, he was sworn‚ and at every eyre of the forest he was
bound 10 present him before the justices in eyre, under pain of liis
wood being taken into the king’s hands.

A woodward, 111611, was nothing more than a private forester,
sworn to protect the king's interests. 11 a trespass was committed in
his wood and was discovered 101 1116 first time by the royal forester,
the wood was taken into the king’s hands. Of this a good example
occurred in the Buckinghamshire eyre 01 1255, which is enrolled ²¹ as
follows :

Presentatum est per forestarios 61 uiridarios et conuictum quod in
uigilia sancti Edmundi martiris anno etc. tricesimo quinto circa horam
nonam duo mastini domini S. (le P. scilicet unus fuscus et unus niger
inuenti 1116111111 111 bosco dicti S. apud H. dilacerantes unum brokettum

boscus capiatur in manu domini regis.

The Bangers.

Towards the end of the fourteenth century, we meet a new ofliccr,
who was styled a ranger. His duties were considered by Manwood
to relate to the purlieus or districts which were disafforested in the
great disafforestment of the year 1301. It is, however, impossible to
explain his (1111166 and status, or the laws which prevailed in the
forest purlieus‚ without an investigation 01 1116 history 01 1116 1016616
111 1116 1011116611111 century, which 1166 011161(16 1116 scope 01 1116 present
work. Itis sufficient to remark that the rangers are seldom 111611-
tioned³ in documents of the reign of Edward 111. ; that they may be

¹ A woodward was not entitled to carry
bows and arrows in the forest, but only an
axe. The following is a recital in the

 

record of the case mentioned on p. xi above :

of the New Forest, and in similar letters of
two days later Thomas of Croydon is de-
