Arrow with its members and wood which Gerard de Camville holds,
the town of Greater Salford with its members which the prior of
Kenilworth holds, the town of Abbot’s Salford with its wood which
the abbot of Evesham holds, the town of Weethley with its wood which

Alexander de Abbetot holds.

And all the towns aforesaid and hamlets with their woodS‚ wastes,
and plains were afforested by the aforesaid king John to the damage
of all the tenants above mentioned. And concerning this they say
that in the first year of the coronation of the lord king Henry the
great-grandfather of the lord king who now is, there was no forest in
the county of Warwick, nor was any part of the forest of Feckenham
in that county. But they say that a certain part of the town of
Tardebigge, which the abbot of Bordsley holds, and which at the time
of the coronation of the aforesaid lord king the great-grandfather of
the lord king who now is, was in the county of Stafford, is now in
this county. And this part extends along the king's highway which
leads from the town of Bromsgrove towards the town of Alcester‚ from
the brock which is called Wychibrook as far as Foxhunt Lydiate to
the west of the same highway. But who afforested it, or in the time
of what king that part was afforested‚ they know not.

And the jurors, on being asked how they know that the aforesaid
lord king John afforested all the manors, towns, and hamlets aforesaid,
say that they know by what their ancestors have related and by the
common talk of the country.

In witness whereof the aforesaid j urors have put their seals to this
perambulation.
