1ᾧο GLossARr

of auger is described as a ⁴ restnauegar!
It will be remembered that the word
auger formerly had an initial η (500
Skeat’s Etymoloqical D‘ictiouary), so
that ‘restnauegar’ is equivalent to
⁴ rest-auger.⁷ Two passages similar to
the one in which the word occurs in
the above-mentioned. inquisition will
be found in the Hundred Rolls (Rot.
Hmzd. i. 22, 26), but they have been
wrongly transcribed and printed. The
true readings are printed on p. 122
above.
tena (p. 78), a cap.

dieunt . . . .quod Reginaldus [Dingge]
uenit in quadam grangia et uoluit luctare
cum predicto Roberto, ipso Roberto in-
uito, ita quod cepit ipsum et ipsum pro-
strauit ad terrain et tenam suam de
capite suo cepit et in luto proiecit
(Coram Reye Rozls 106, Rot. 2).

teyngre (pp. 80, 81, 90, 97). Τ110 mean-
ing of this word is probably ‘tawny.
It is usually represented by its first
five letters and a superior e which
may be taken to denote the letters
νας 111 0110 case, however, it is written
in an extended form as ‘teyngres’
(p. 97). Even with the aid of philo-
logical evidence, it is difficult to assign
a meaning to this word. It was seldom
used, and only of the colour of grey-
hounds. The colours of these animals
are often mentioned in the forest
rolls; they are few in number. The
plain ones are ‘famus' ‘rubeus,’
‘ruffus‚’ ‘niger’ and ‘albus’ Four
combinations of colours are also men-
tioned, namely‚ techele or techelatus,
coueire, tigrus and uerrus, examples
of the use of which are printed in this
Glossary. It is probable that ‘ teyngre ¹
was a plain colour differing slightly
both from ‘rubeus’ and ‘ruffus‘
These three words evidently repre-
sented different colours, for they are
all three used in the same roll (see
pp. 96, 97, 103, above). The following
passage occurs in an eyre roll of
15 Ed. i. :

011111 duobus leporariis quorum unus

erat albus et alius niger taunatus (For.
Proc„ Tr. of Rea, No. 76, Rot. 13.

If ‘ taunatus' represents a Latin form
of ‘teyngre‘ its association to ‘niger'

is exceptional. It should be 00111-
pared with ‘niger coueratus‚’ ‘rubeus
couere' and ‘faluus ruffus.‘ See
couere and saluus above.

‘cesare (pp. 5, 73), thesare (p. 77), to
worry. The word was in constant use
in the thirteenth century to describe
the worrying of deer by dogs.

tetchelatus (p. 77), ticked. The form
‘ techele ’ is also used. Thus:

cum quatuor leporariis quorum duo
fuerunt nigri, unus albus, et unus
333{1ZesseclfiFor. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, 132,

duos leporarios quorum quidam fuit
albus, et alter tetchele (For. Proa, Tr.
of Rea, 128, slata 2).

tigrus (M. F. tigre), tiger marked. This
word occurs several times in a roll of

forest inquisitions of the years 16 to 18
Ed. i. (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rec., No. 128).

011111 11110 leporario tigro (skin. 2).
011111 lepor-ariis quorum unus tig’ et
alter faluus (ibid).

cepit unum lepor-arium tigrum
(skin 3).

It should be observed that no particular
colours are mentioned.

trenchia, or trenchea (p. 30). In the
thirteenth century this word was not
used of a ditch or furrow. It seems to
have denoted along and narrow clearing
in a wood. Thus :

facte fuerunt due trenchee . . . uide-
licet, una de quercubus et subboseo et
altera de subbosco tantum. . . . Et

fuerunt uenditores et receptores . . .
quirespondunt . . . (For. Proc„ Tr. of
Rea„ 76, Rot. 8).

In some letters patent dated 20 Novem-
ber 1316, we have:

concessimus . . . quod ipse quandam
trencheam quadraginta acrarum bosci
. . . facere et arbores infra predictas
quadraginta acras bosci succindere uen-
dere et quo uoluerit cariare (Patent
Roll 145, m. 7).

Again in the Hampshire eyre rolls of
8 Ed. i. the following passage occurs:

Dominus rex precepit fieri uendici-
onem bosci in ballia M. de C„ unde in
bosco de D. facte fuerunt due trenche,
uidelicet, una in longitudine et alia in
transuerso. Et altera trenchea facta
suit in F. longitudine et extransucrso
