was not contrary to the provision of the Charter which directed
the foresters and verderers to assemble every forty days to view the
attachments as well of the vert as of the venison; for that direction
may relate to ministerial rather than judicial proceedings. Nor had
the court jurisdiction to try cases relating to the vert except where
the trespasses were small. The distinction between small and great
trespasses was of course definite, and not in the discretiori of
the forest officers; but it seems certain that it varied in different
forests. We know what it was in the forest of Sherwood 3 for in the
fifteenth year of Edward Ι. Sir William (16 Vescy and his colleagues‚
then justices in eyre at Nottingham, finding that the assize of the
forest was not being properly observed, issued an ordinance ¹ with the
object of regulating the jurisdiction of the court of attachments. It pro-
vided that the verderers were to assemble every forty days to hold at-
tachments both concerning the vert and the venison‚ and concerning
the holding and pleading of small pleas which ought to be pleaded
in attachments, such as those pleas which were touched upon in other
provisions of the ordinance. Though the language of the ordinance
is ill chosen‚ its meaning 16 clear. The ministerial 16 distinguished
from 1116 judicial business, which is explained in some detail as follows.
People who lived in the forest and were taken in the king’s demesne
woods cutting saplings 01 branches 01 dry wood from 06116, 01 hazels,
or 1110111, or 6 11166, 01 66 alder‚ or a holly tree and such like trees,
might be amerced in the attachment court unless the sapling were
appraised at more than four pence, in which case the offender was to
be attached to answer for his trespass at the next eyre. Again‚ all
trespasses in the outlying woods, outside the king's demesne woods,
were to be pleaded in the attachments unless they were pleas which
belonged to the eyre of the justices. This provision is certainly a little
vague, but it would seem that trespasses to the vert in woods within
the forest, but belonging to the king's subjecte, were to be classified
in the same way as trespasses in his demesne woods for the purpose
of determining the jurisdiction of the court of attachment. Finally,
there is a provision that all escapes of beasts of the plough in the
king’s demesne enclosures and woods were to be pleaded in the
attachments 3 as were also other trespasses outside the assize of the
forest and against the Charter of the Forest.

Now this ordinance ought not to be considered as creating a
new law throughout England. It was issued by the justices in eyre
