GLOSSARY 1 3 7

bracenarius. This word occurs re-

peatedly in a VVardrobe Account of
18 Ed. i. (Accozmts, Q.R., Bmzclle 352,
No. 26). It appears to have meant a
fewterer or person in charge of grey-
hounds and to have been used in place
of the word ualtrarius, which is not
found in the account.

brokettuS, a brocket. In the later middle

ages deer were called by different names
according to their ages. Manwood
states that a hart of the first year is
called a hind calf‚ of the second a
brocket, of the third, a spayard, and so
on. In the thirteenth century a few
only of these names were in use, and
they had not then the meanings which
they afterwards obtained. The special
names for deer of one, two, and three
years came into use before those for deer
of a greater age, which latter, indeed,
were probably only used pedantically.
The word ‘brokettus‚' though used in the
time of Manwood exclusively of a hart
of the second year, was in the thirteenth
century used also of the buck (pp. 92,
93, above), and the forest documenta
disclose no evidence as to the age
which the word implied. An early ex-
ample of its use is found in some
letters close of 26 March 1223* (Rot.
Litt. Olaus. ii. 178).
bulso (M. F. boujon, p. 1), a kind of arrow.
Another form of this word is ‘bosun '
(p. 79), which occurs in For. Proc.‚ Tr.
of Rea„ No. 82. The form ‘ bosoun ' is
also found in Britton. See Britton (ed.
Nichols)‚ vol. ii. p. 11.

The following passage occurs on the
Dorset eyre rolls of 8 Ed. i. :

Radulfus de Stopham tenet manerium
de Bryxaneston’ quod ualet xx libr’ per
annum per serianciam ad inueniendum
domino regi quocienscunque contigerit
ipsum habere exercitum in Angl' uel in
Walliam unum garcionem differentem
unum arcum sine corda et unum buzo-
nem sine pennis ad sumptus suos pro-
prios per quadraginta dies (Assize Rolls
204, Rot. 36 d).

In two inquisitione of a later date
the word ‘ tribulus ’ is substituted for
‘buzo’z

predictum manerium tenetur de rege
per seruicium inueniendi unum hominem

in braccis et camisia et nudum pedes
per quadraginta dies sumptibus suis
propi-iis iu obsequium regis cum in
partes Wallie profecturus fuerit haben-
tem unum arcum sine corda et unum
tribulum non pennatum tenentem maio-
rem finem dicti tribuli in manu sua

(Inq. post mortem, second numbers, 24
Ed.iz'2·. No. 30).

que tenentur de rege in capite per
seruicium inueniendi unum hominem in
excercitu regis in partibus Scocie pro-
fecturi nudum pedes camisia et braccis
uestitum habentem in una manu sua
unum arcum sine corda et altera manu
unum tribulum non pennatum (Inq.
post mortem, second numbers, 27 Ed.

iiz. No. 40).
The M.F. ‘tribule ’ is usually translated
by the English ‘ caltrop.’ According
to the New Enylish Dictionary, vol. ii.
p. 43, the latter word was applied in
Old English to brambles or buckthorn.
The following passage, therefore, sug-
gests that the ordinary translation of
the mediaeval Latin ‘tribulus ’ may be

‘ buckthorn ' :
de subbosco, uidelicet, spinarum coru-

lorum et tribulorum in uiginti acris (Ac-
cozmts, Eaech. Q.R.,Bumlze 145, No. 5).

It is improbable, however, that the
word ‘tribulus’ mentioned in the ex-
tracts from the inquisitions quoted
above meant a shaft of buckthorn.

The syllable tri seems to point to an
arrow head with a triangular cross
seotion, that is to say, to a three-faced
head.

The description of the serjeanty of
Ralph of Stopham suggests that the
‘ bulso ' or ‘ buso ' usually had feathers
on it. The stringless bow and the
featherless arrow were probably eln-
blems of office.

cableicium (p. 60), or cablicium (MF.

chablie), windfallen trees. Littre thus
defines the corresponding word in the
modern French:

Le chablis est le bois que la force du
vent ou quelque orage abat dans les
forete.

The word occurs frequently on the
Close Rolls of 7 Henry iii. In the winter
of that year a great storm burst over
the country, which gave rise to a large
