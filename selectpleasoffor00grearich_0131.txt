warren.

It may here be observed that the public had a right 01 hunting
beasts ferae naturae in all unenclosed kinds, unless the lands were
subject to the forest laws or to some restriction upon hunting
arising out 01 0 royal grant. Probably the only limit to the
right was that it could not be exercised in such a way as to injure
property. A direct statement to this effect is not 10 be found in
any of our mediaeval treatises on law. But the object 01 chartei-s 01
warren and the laws relating to them would be inexplicable if the
public had not the right 01 hunting on unenclosed lands outside
forests, chases and warrens.¹ .

The word ‘ Warren’ was used to denote either the exclusive right
01 hunting and taking certain beasts ι71611113 naturae in a particular piece
of land or the land-over which such right extended. William the
Conqueror granted ² that the abbot and monks 01 Battle should have
warren in all places belonging to their monastery. In the 111011111
century the kings 01 England made many grants 01 warren both to
religious bodies and private individuals. Their successors 01 1110
thirteenth century, John, Henry HI. and Edward 1., 1110(10 1011511 grants
01 1110 same nature, and by the middle 01 1110 fourteenth century it is
probable that the majority 01 lords 01 manors enjoyed this right in
virtue 01 grants to them or their ancestors.

Throughout the middle ages there was little change in the form 01
1110 operative part of a chartei· of warren. It consisted 01 three prin-
cipal clauses. The first was a formal grant 01 1100 warren 111 1110
(1011105110 lands 01 1110 person to whom the charter was granted. The
second declared that the grant was subject to a proviso that the lands
were not within the metes 01 1110 king’s 101051; 011(1 1110 third pre-
scribed the mode in which the grant was to be enjoyed: namely, in
such 0 way that no person might enter the land to hunt on it or to
take anything which belonged to warren without the licence and will
of the grantee or his 110115 under pain 01 0 1011011010 01 ten pounds.
