THE LESSER COURTS OF THE FOREST XXXV

cessful resistance.l Peter de Neville, for instance, the warden of
Rutland, seems to have appropriated to himself, among many other
things, pleas of thorns, hazels and such like small vert, which would
'be pleaded in attachment courts. The justices in eyre, it is true, in
1269 ordered him to answer for the profits of his misappropriationS, but
the eyre rolls do not tell us whether the order was obeyed or not, and
one of his successors in title undoubtedly died seised of nearly all, if
not all, that he claimed.2

Again, we may search in vain among the eyre rolls of the reign of
Henry III. for proof ³ that the verderers accounted in the eyre for wood
which had been unlawfully cut in the forests south of the Trent.
It may be that in strict law they were bound to account for it ; but the
absence of any evidence that they did so renders it probable that the
law was not strictly observed in this respect.⁴

We have seen that the finding pledges for offences against the
vert in the forest of Sherwood. and probably elsewhere, took place in
the attachment court. But the Charter of the Forest speaks of
attachments as well of the vert as of the venison, and we should there-
fore expect to find poachers attached there in just the same way as
trespassers to the vert. It is, however, probable that in many forests

pledges for the appearance of poachers at the eyre were not found in
the attachment courts, and that the direction in the Charter was not
strictly observed in this respect. It was considered sufficient for the
offender to be attached in the presence of the foresters and verderers
in the manner which we shall describe presently.5

To summarise; the court of attachments was a court which,

41 Hen. iii. in some of the forests of Wilt-

dated 13 September 1300. But although
shire was rendered at the eyre of 1257 by

he appears to have received no privileges

John earl of Warwick. (For. Proc„ Tr. of
Rea, No. 198, Roll 7.) The profits of the
courts were described as ‘ small pleas.’
The following is t'ne account rendered for
30 Hen. iii. :

from the king which had not been enjoyed
by his father Peter, his descendant Anne
Chiselden was found by inquisition dated
23 March 1443 to have died seised of the
custody of the forest of Rutland ‘cum

forestariorum, extractibus swanimottorum

et amonendi omnes forestarios eiusdem
foreste ad uoluntatem suam.‘ (Inq. post
mortem, 23 Hen. vi. No. 14.)

³ In a few cases it may be found that the
verderers accounted at the eyre for wood
which had been unlawfully cut, but such
cases are quite exceptional.

·¹ The explanation may be that the
amercement at the eyre was considered to
include the price of the wood.
