lxii INTRODUOTION

an inadequate enrolment. The colloquy between the verderer and
justices would help usto understand some of the details of the pro-
cedure of the court, but nothing so frivolous adorns the records of a
forest eyre. This and other causes, however, tend to show that when
any further inquiry ¹ was made before the itinerant justices about the
matters presented to them, it was by way of certification rather than
of rehearing.2

We have already seen3 that the townships were amerced in the
forest eyre for not having come fully to make an inquisition, ii they
had been unable to ascertain anything about the matters for which
they were summoned or anything sufficient to satisfy the justices.
In many of the forest eyre rolls the amercements of the townships are
written above their names in the clauses which state their defaults.
But sometimes instead of seeing a sum of money thus interlineated,
we see the word ‘ alibi' in its place. This, however, only happens
where the township, above the name of which the word ‘alibi' is
found, has aleady been amerced for not having come to some other
forest inquisition. Thus at the Huntingdon eyre of 1255 the townships⁴
of Great Stukeley, Abbots Ripton‚ Hartford and King’s Ripton were
amerced for not having come fully to a special inquisition held ⁵ on the
22nd March 1253> and the amercement of each of these townships is
duly written above its name in the eyre roll. In the month of April,
1255, another special inquisition was held by the townships of King’s
Ripton‚ Abbots Ripton, Hartford and Little Stukeley. At the eyre
held shortly afterwards, all these townships were put in mercy6 for
not having come fully to the inquisition. But instead of a sum of
money the word ‘alibi’ appears in the eyre roll above the names
of three of the townships—namely, Kings Ripton, Abbots Ripton and
Hartford-—all of which had been amerced for not coming fully to the
inquisition of the 22nd March 1253. On the other hand, the amerce-
