rolls of the Nottingham forest cyre 01 15 Ed. Ι. 110 searched, it will
110 found that in one case ¹ the roe does appear as a beast of the forest.
But as this is a single case we may infer that the roe was not common
in the county.2 Its absence from the words defining venison in the
chartei· of 1212 may therefore be explained by its scamity, the drafts-
man of the charter probably omitting it because he was under the
impression that it was not found in the counties of Nottingham and
Derby, rather than with the express intention of excluding it.

It must, however, be conceded that although the roe was a beast
of the forest it was not always looked upon with favour even by the
king. Thus in a charter 3 of liberties granted to the Abbey of Abing-
don, king Richard I. allowed the monks to take all roes which theyr
could find in a certain district, but not harts and hinds‚ without

his licence. Other 0111101100ῆι could be adduced to the same effect, but
’ itis 1101 inconsistent with the roe being a beast of the forest, as to
which the evidence of the eyre rolls is conclusive.

THE FOREST OFFICERS.

Fon the purpose of forest administration England was divided into
two provinces, one of which lay to the north, the other 10 1110 south
of the river Trent. This division ⁵ was made in the year 1238, when

² Of this we have some further evidence
from a memorandum on the same rolls
which states that three hundred and fifty
harts, hinds‚ bueks‚ does, and prickets died
of murrain in the fourteenth year of Ed—
ward i.‚ but which says nothing of roes.
(Ibidem, Rozl 5 111 dorso.)

³ The grant was by a charter dated
29 March 1190, of which an inspeximus is
enrolled on the Charter Roll of 10 Ed. iii.
The words of the charter which confer the
liberty are as follows: ‘Et omnes capre-
olos, quos ibi inuenire poterunt, accipiant et
ceruos et cernas non accipiant nisi nostra
licencia.’ (Charter Roll 131, Ent. 30.)

⁴ Although the roe in the thirteenth
century was a beast of the forest and not a
beast of the warren, king John granted to
william Picot by a chartei· dated 14 April

1209 free warren of roes. Thus: ‘Sciatis
nos dedisse et concessisse et per cartam
nostram confirmasse Willelmo Picot liberam
warennam de cheuerellis et leporibus et
cuniculis et fesantis et perdicibus in terra
sua de Dudinton' et de Torp’ quam longe
lateque terra illa se extendit, ita quod
nemo in ea capiat cheuerellum uel leporem
1101 cuniculos uel fesantos uel perdices sine
assensu suo et licencia sua super forisfac-
turam decem librarum ’ (Rotzcli Chartam-um,
p. 185).

A grant of warren of roes was, however,
exceptional.

⁵ On 22 May 1238, John Biset was
appointed justice of the forest south of the
Trent. (See Patent Roll 47, m. 6.)
Robert of Ros had been appointed justice
of the forest in the counties of Not-
tingham, Derby, Yorkshire‚ Lancaster,
