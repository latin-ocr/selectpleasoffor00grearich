Northumberland there was an extensive forest until the year 1280,
when Edward Ι. disafforested¹ it in return for an annual rent of forty
pounds. In Lancashire there was no royal forest in the reign of
Edward L, because the king had granted the honour of Lancaster to
his brother Edmund Crouchback‚ who was allowed to enforce the
forest laws over the forests which it contained. It is also evident that
there was a forest in Sussex at the beginning of the thirteenth century,
for a perambulation² of it is recorded on the roll of letters close of
9 Henry ΠΙ.

of England possessed any forests in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk
and Kent. There are no appointments of wardens and no grants
of privileges which suggest the existence of any such forest3 there
are no records of a forest eyre, and no letters patent appointing
justices for an eyre in any of these counties; nor are there any
corresponding entries of fines and amercements for offences against
the forest law on the Great Rolls of the Exchequer. For similar
reasons it may be considered as probable that there were either
no forests in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire‚ and Herthrdshire, or
forests of a small extent only. But there is more occasion for doubt
about these three counties than about Norfolk, Suffolk and Kent.
Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire had a common sheriff, and
they are treated as a single county on the Great Rolls of the
Exchequer. It is therefore possible that some of the fines and
amercements there recorded for forest trespasses relate to Cambridge-
shire, and not to Huntingdonshire, in which there was undoubtedly
a forest. The same difficulty occurs with respect to Bedfordshire‚
which had a sheriff in common with Buckinghamshire, and with
respect to Hertfordshire, which had one in common with Essex. In
Middlesex there was at one time a warren at Staines, which was
also subject to the forest laws. This is evident from a chartei· of
18 August 1227, by which Henry ΠΙ. disafforested ³ the warren and
declared it free from all that pertained to forest and forester. With
this exception there was certainly no forest in Middlesex in the
thirteenth‚ and probably none in the twelfth century.

In all the other counties ⁴¹ there were forests varying considerably
in size. Those which were most frequented by the kings were
