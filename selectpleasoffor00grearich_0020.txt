already scarce in the thirteenth century. Entries on the forest eyre
rolls show that it belonged 10 1110 same class of animals as the red
deer, the fallow deer and the roe; but such entries occur seldom, and
in many of the rolls of the great cyre, which began in 1256 and ex-
tended over many 0011111105, the wild boar is not mentioned at all.¹
But besides omitting one animal from 1115 1151 of beasts of the
forest, Manwood wrongly inserted two others. The hare should have
no place in his list of such beasts. If we look through the rolls of the
forestS, we find that, except in a few special instances, the hare was
not preserved by the forest laws. It 15 true that it enjoyed a certain
measure of protection by reason of the assiae? which prohibited grey-
hounds and dogs from being brought within the forest, but 11115 pro-
10011011 was a mere incident of 1110 assize, which was enacted for the
preservation of other animals. Nevertheless 1110 forest rolls show that
the hare was undoubtedly preserved in one forest, in which it was the
subject of the same laws as the deer of different species, and the wild
boar. This forest was the warren ³ of Somerton, within the boundaries
of which the king specially preserved the hare as a beast of the
forest. It is impossible that an animal so common throughout
England could be preserved elsewhere without some mention of it
being found in the forest rolls. Moreover, except in districts of small
area, its preservation would have been an intolerable burden to the
country. For example, one of the forest laws required that, when-
ever a beast of the forest was found dead or wounded an inquest forth-
with should be held upon it by four neighbouring townships ; and
records of such inquests in the warren of Somerton still exist. To

quadragesimo quidam aper inuentus fuit
occisus in ballius. (1013Ιο11011οῑ0, Inquisicio

quiores, scilicet, Lydeney, Ettelou’, Aylbris-

ideo in misericordia.' (Forest Proceedinys.
Trmsury of Receipt, No. 28, Rozl 4 d.)

Another example occurs on the rolls of
the same eyre:

‘ Presentatum est per forestarios et uiri-
darios et conuictum quod Reginaldus
Yolewe et lValterus Wytenot occiderunt
unum porcum in foresta de Dene: super
quem capti fuerunt et missi apud Glouc'
ad imprssonandum, et modo non ueniunt.'
(Ibid. Rolz 4.»

Pleas of the forest were divided into two

relating to the venison. The word venison
was applied 10 the beasts of the forest.
There 15 evidence apart from the rolls of
forest pleas, that the word included the
wild boar as well 05 the red and fallow deer
and the roe. On 29 October 1225 two
hunters were sent into the forest of Dean
to take twelve boars for the king’s use. On
the following day a writ was sent 10 the
constable of St. Briavels with respect to
venison taken by these hunters. (Ratun
Litterarum Clausarmn, vol. ii. p. 84.)
Again, in some letters close of 1 November
1226. we have the words, ‘decima uenacionis
de porcis.' (Ibid. 157.)

² By the 0551κο of Woodstock, which is
attributed to the year 1184, people were
forbidden to have greyhounds in the forest.
