THE LESSER COURTS OF THE FOREST XXXiX

made the inquisition, 10 find pledges to come before the justices in
eyre. The owner of the field waS, no doubt, considered a suspected
person. Subsequent inquisitione, however, show that the four
neighbours usually found no pledges, although it frequently happened 1
that the four townships and the finder of the beast and persons under
suspicion did so.

Numerous examples² show that when an arrow was found in a
dead 01· wounded beast of the forest, it was delivered to the *verderen
But the verderer, instead of being allowed to retain it for his own use
as the words of the ‘ Consuetudines et Assise’ suggest, was bound to
keep it for production before the justices at the next forest eyre. The
justices probably received them, together with any antlers ³ and skins
which might be produced at the eyre, for the use of the king and not
as perquisites for themselves. Being articles of small value, they
were not sent to the king one by one, but were collected instead by
the justices in eyre.

Inquisitions by the four neighbouring townships were also held
when trespasses had been committed in the forest. Persons whom the
townships found to have been guilty of offences against the venison,
were either sent to prison ⁴ or attached there and then to appear before
the justices in eyre according to the gravity of the trespass. The
bows, arrows and snares5 which were found upon a trespasser were
delivered to a verderer for him to produce before the justices just as
were arrows found in wounded beasts. On the other hand, if grey-
hounds were found in the forest belonging to poachers or straying in
pursuit of venison, they were 561116 forthwith to the justice of the
forest and not detained for production before the justices in eyre;
but it is probable that the justice handed them over to the king, as
soon as he received them.

The ordinary ministeria] work of attaching trespassers against the
venison to appear at the next forest cyre seems to have been done
in the special inquisition, and not in the court of attachments. If
we look at the records of special inquisitions, we find repeated 111-
stances of persons being attached to appear at the next forest eyre‚
and the statement of the attachment always forms part of the record
