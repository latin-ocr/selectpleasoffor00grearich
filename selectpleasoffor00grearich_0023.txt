THE FmOEST OFFICERs XV

a justice of the forest was appointed for each province. Before that
date, although there had more than once been two such justiceS, to
each of whom was assigned a particular group of counties‚ there was
nsually one only,1 the ‘Capitalis Forestarius’2 of the Charter.
The business of the justices was ministerial rather than judiciale
They were not required by virtue of their office to be present
either in person or by deputy at any of the forest courts3 but
the king as a general rule included them in commissions ³ to justices
to hear and determine forest pleas. At the beginning of the fourteenth
century, although there was no sudden change in their duties, they
ceased to be described in the king’s Chancery as justices, and received
instead the less distinguished designation of war-dens, which continued
in use until the reign of Richard IL, when the title of justice was
again revived.

One of their principal ministerial duties was to release on bail
prisoners who were detained in custody for offences in the royal
forestS. This was no light work: any poacher caught in the act of
killing a decr, or with venison in his possession, was forthwith
sent to prison, from which he could only be released on an order
from the justice of the forest or from the king himself. But besides
this and other special duties of a similar character, they supervised
the whole forest administration, held special inquisitions on the
expediency of proposed royal grants of liberties‚ and in general
carried out all the executive work relating to the forests.

The justices of the forest occasionally in the thirteenth century
and frequently in the fourteenth century performed their duties by
deputy. In the reign of Edward HI. it was the practice for general
inquisitions concerning the state of the forest to be held before the
j ustices or their deputies‚‘¹ who were styled lieutenants of the justice.
As a rule the deputy seems to have been appointed by the justice;
but there are cases in which the appointment was made by the king.

¹ The >justices of the forest were some-
times styled ‘Protoforestarii.' Mathew
Paris (Chronica Maiora, Rolls Series, vol.
iv.), for instance, so describes John Biset
(p. 88); but he also calls him ‘suminus
Anglie forestarius' (ibid), and ‘suminus
iusticiarius foreste ⁷ (p. 174).
