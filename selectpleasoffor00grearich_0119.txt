THE CHASE, THE PARK AND THE WARREN 0Χὶ

Ν6611’6 ‘ History of Worcestershire‚’ of the ⁶ ancient liberties, royalty
and customs belonging to the lordship and franches of Handley and
unto the chase of Malvern' the following article occurs:

Item, is: any of the foresters find any person or persons hunting
within the said chase or bounds thereos or standing suspiciously‚ viz.
stahle standing, with hounds drawing or bloody hands, the same forester
shall attach him or them, and bring them unto the castle of Handley, there
to remain prisoners in a place called Bandbury chamber, until they have
found sureties sufficient of their good harhouring against the game by
obligation in c. shillings to the lord’s use, to be levied upon the forfeiture of

them 01· their surety.

Thus there was a considerable difference in procedure in royal
forests and private chases. In forests the trespassers were arrested
and detained in prison until they found pledges to appear at the
forest eyre, when they were again imprisoned until they paid ransom.
In chases‚ trespassers were merely detained in prison until they
satisfied the lord with respect to their offences; and they could only
be detained when they were taken with the mainour. It is probable
that the measure of satisfaction to which the lord was entitled varied
in different chases, but it may be regarded as certain that he could
nowhere act arbitrarily. Any fine which he might exact would be
either limited in amount or subject to assessment in his court.

But there is at least one case in which the whole body of forest
laws was enforced over a private forest. On 28 June 1266,
Henry ΙΠ. granted ¹ the castles‚ lands and tenements which had been
forfeited by Robert, earl of Derby, to his own second son, Edmund,
commonly called Crouchback. On 30 June 1267, 116 granted2 him
the honour, county‚ castle and town of Lancaster and all the king’s
demesnes in the county of Lancasten with the vaccaries and forests
of VViresdale and Lonsdale, and the manor, castle and forest of
Pickering in Yorkshire. These two grants seem to have included
all the forests in the 6011111)γ of Lancaster, which had hitherto been
treated as forests in the strict sense of the word.. Hencesorth,
however, they were intended to be held by Edmund, not as forests‚
but as free chases. Accordingly when in 15 Edward Ι. 6 forest
eyre was held at Lancaster by three justices who had recently been
appointed to hold pleas³ of the forest in the counties north of the
Trent‚ those offences only were punished which had been committed
