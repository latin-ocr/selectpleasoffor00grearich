'I'he Foresters in Fee.

In most of the larger forests there were, in addition to the wardens,
verderers and ordinary foresters, certain other offlam-s, who were
styled foresters in fee. It is impossible to describe even in general
terms the conditions under which they held office, varying as those
conditions did in different forests. All that the -words ‘forester in
see ’ necessarily connoted was a forester holding his office hereditarily.
Thus Robert of Everingham, the hereditary warden of Sherwood
Forest‚ is described¹ on the eyre rolls of 15 Ed. Ι., as a forester in
see. But when applied to him or to any other hereditary warden the
words are embarrassing, as they were usually applied to hereditary
foresters subordinate to a warden‚ and it is convenient to have a name
for such officials.

Let us consider some examples. In the forest of Dean ² there
were eight or nine foresters in fee, each concerned with a particular
district or bailiwick to the exclusion of his fellows, but all subordinate
to the constable of St. Briavells‚ who was warden of the forest. As
a body of officials, whose collective authority extended over the whole ³
forest, outnumbering the verderers‚ and independent of the warden,
they must have possessed great influence in the management of
forest business. In many of the forests there was no such body;
there was, for example, none in Rutland. On the other hand, in
certain forests there were foresters in fee who did not, as in the
forest of Dean, constitute a special class, although they individually
exercised a greater authority by reason of the magnitude of their
bailiwicks. In the vast forest or group of sorests between the bridges
of Stamford and Oxford there were several foresters in fee. One had
for his bailiwick the forest of Bernwood, another the forest of Which-
wood. These were not the only forests between the two bridges 3 there
were besides the forests of Rockingham, Cliffe, Salcey‚ Whittlewood
and Huntingdon‚ in some of which there were no foresters in fec.
Thus the foresters in sce in Bernwood and Whichwood, instead of
having a coordinate authority which extended over a whole forest, were
officials each of whom had the charge of one of a group of seven forests.

There is a question which forces itself upon our notice at this
point, and must be considered. By whom were the foresters in fce
