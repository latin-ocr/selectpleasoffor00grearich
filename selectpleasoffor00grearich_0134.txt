cxxvi INTRODUOTION

Iuratores dicunt super sacramentum suum quod predictus Ricardus
predictis die et anno semel tantum intrauit warennam predictam et in eadem
fugauit et duos lepores ibidem cepit et asportauit contra uoluntatem ipsius
abbatis et contra pacem etc. ad dampnum ipsius abbatis sex denariorum.
Ideo consideratum est quod predictus abbas recuperet dampna sua predicta
sex denariorum uersus predictum Ricardum; et idem Ricardus capiatur ; et
dominus rex habeat decem libras de forisfactura etc. secundum statutum etc.

It is not to be understood that whenever it was proved that a
trespass had been committed, there was a forfeiture of ten pounds or
of any partos that sum. When the suit was brought in the king's
court no doubt a forfeiture was incurred. Unless, however, the
trespass was serious, it was not tried in the king's court, but in the
court of the lord os the warren, or if there were none, perhaps in the
hundred or county court. If a trespass were brought before the lord
of the warren in the lord's court and the offence was proved, there
seems to have been 110 procedure by way of forfeiture. The king or
his officers would have no notice either of the trespass or of its trial.
Moreover, trespasses in warrens must have been common offences. If
there were forfeit-ures on conviction in the courts of lords of warreDS,
some trace of them would be found on the records of the exchequer.
On the other hand if the lord had no court, and the proceedings took
place in the hundred or county court, it is possible that the for-
feiture may have been enforced in them on the king's behalf. If it
were enforcecL there would not necessarily be any trace of it on the
records of the exchequer. The hundred courts in many parts of the
country had, at an early date, been granted to subjects who would
claim forfeitures for breach of warren as their own property. Hundred
courts, when not in the hands of subjects, and county courts were
fai-med by the sheriffs at a fixed annual sum, and they, too, would
make a similar claim. Thus there would be no account rendered at
the exchequer of foi-feitures for breach of warren, in a suit sor trespass
111 either of these courts.

Another remedy to which the lord of a warren might have
recourse for a breach of his franchise was the impounding of the
greyhounds‚ nets or snares of the persons trespassing‚ and the deten-
tion of them until satisfaction had been made for the trespass. 1t
would appear that fflis method of procedure was a common one, as
numerous examples of it are to be found in the Plea Rolls of the royal
courts. Thus in 7 Ed. Ι. 1110 king’s attorney alleged¹ that Richard
fitz John, who had free warren 111 1115 (1011105110 lands of Shere, had
