The right of warren was not considered 10 be appmtenaut to land.
If anyone who had received a grant of warren in his demesne lands
assigned the lands to another, the assignee acquired the lands without
the warren, because the grant, if in the usual form, had been made to
the assignor and his heirS, not to the assignor, his heirs and assigns.
Upon such an assignment taking place the lands were liable to be
diswarrened. Thus in November-1292 John of Seton was 3001111011οᾰι
before Hugh of Cressingham and his fellows, justices in eyre at Carlisle,
io answer to the king by what warrant he claimed to have free warren
in Lamonby. John came and said that King Henry ΙΠ. 11οᾶ granted
to a certain Robert of Haunton, whose assign he was, free warren in
all dis demesne lands in Lamonby, and produced a chartei· in witness
thereos. In reply the king's attorney said that as John was not the
heir nor of the blood of Rnbert, he could not claim warren by any
charter made 10 Robert, on the ground that he showed no special deed
to him or his 0110031013 ; and he demanded judgment. It was
adjudged that John’s land in Lamonby should be diswarrened.2
