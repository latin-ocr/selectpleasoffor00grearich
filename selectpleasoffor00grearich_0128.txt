CXX INTRODUCTION

in aliquo contra pacem domini regis. Et si contingat ipsum in aliquo
predictorum malefacere, plegii sui respondebunt de corpore eius et de trans-
gressione. Si uero aliquis subito captus fuerit in parco uel uiuario sine
inquisitione facienda per breue domini regis habebit prisonam domini regis
ut predictum est, et postea debet redimi modo predicto; et ex illa redemp-
tione habebit dominus rex medietatem et lesus aliam; et postea inueniet
duodecim plegios, modo predicto.

This is not the full text of the new law. It contains none of the
introductory words which are always found in royal diplomas, and 11
appears to be rather the description of the law than the material part
of its text. Indeed it is at least open to doubt whether the new law
ever came into operation. Neither on the plea rolls nor elsewhere is
there evidence that recourse was frequently had to its provisions It
is, however, significant that Matthew Paris speaks of it as a law ‘ cum
rigoris incremento‚’¹ from which it may be inferred that there had
previously been some punishment for the offences against which it
was directed. As in all actions for trespass in the king's bench the
defendant might, if judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff, be
impr-isoned‚ an explanation of the words ‘cum rigoris incremento’
may be that the second part of the new law was intended to specify
a particular degree of punishment in a particular kind of trespass.
The enforcement of a law imposing a punishment of this nature would
in the thirteenth century in a large measure depend upon the will of
the king's justices. In the same way the operation of that part of the
new law which related to inquisitions upon trespasses in parks could
easily have been defeated by the clerks in Chancery‚ from whom the
writs for holding such inquisitions would be obtained.

Among the Chapters of the Eyre of the latter half of the reign of
Henry ΠΙ. there is an article² concerning malefactors in parks and
stews. This may have had its origin in the newlaw ef the year 1246,
but it is improbable that the king or his advisers intended its enforce-
mcnt in this way. The language in which the law is described
requires either a special inquisition or a procedure by way of action
at the suit of the person injured. The Chapters of the Eyre‚ on the
other hand, formed the basis of a procedure by way of presentment.

The next important alteration in the law relating to trespasses
in parks and stews was made by the Statutes of XVestminstcr of
the year 1275.³ A plaintiff at whose suit a trespasser was at-
tainted was to be awarded substantia] amends, and the trespasscr
