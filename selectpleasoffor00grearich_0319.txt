NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, A.D. 1244)Γ 85

The township of Sudborough finds pledges of being before the
justices of the forest, because it allowed Maurice de Meht to carry
away the skin of the doe.

The chattels of Ralph the son of Mabel were taken into the hand
of the lord king, and appraised by the verderers and foresters at nine
shillings‚ and they were delivered in bail to Thomas of Grafton‚ who
dwells in Sudborough.

Robert of Grafton, the fugitive, and William the son of Henry
had no chattels.

Maurice de Meht was not taken because he said that he was with
Sir Robert Passelewe, then justice of the forest.

It happened on the Monday ‘¹' next before the feast of St. Matthias
the apostle, in the thirty-first year about vespers, that Simon Abbot
and William Scot, his companion, walking foresters in the park
of Brigstock, went between the wood of Ralph of St. Samson and
the park of Brigstock; and they met Henry the son of Gervais, the
fisher of Islip 3 and they asked him who he was ; and he said that he
was with Sir Henry of Drayton, knight. And the aforesaid foresters
sent after the verderers of the country, who came and questioned him
about his company. And the said Henry charged Robert the son of
Quenyl with harbouring‚ and Ralph the son of Robert Quenyl with
complicity, and William of Drayton the son of Sir Henry of Drayton
with complicity. And out of suspicion the verderers and foresters
searched the house of Robert the son of QuenyL and they found a
fletch in it, bloody and broken. The same Henry the son of Gervais
of Islip finds pledges of being before the justices of the forest . . .ss

Robert the son of Quenyl finds pledges for having harboured
Ralph his son, to wit . . .⁷

Ralph the son of Robert the son of Quenyl finds pledges of being
before the justices, to wit . . . ⁷

William the son of Sir Henry of Drayton finds pledges of being
before the justices for the same offence‚ to wit . . . Β

Be it remembered that the fletch found in the house of Robert
the son of Quenyl was delivered to Sir Robert Basset, a verderer.

These are the pledges of Robert the son of William of Lowick
being before the justices for suspicion . . . ⁶
