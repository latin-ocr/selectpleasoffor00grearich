sitting at regular intervals‚ usually every sixth week‚ was chiefly
concerned in trying cases of small trespasses to the vert. The
distinction between small trespasses and large trespasses varied in
different forests,¹ an'd it is impossible, at present, to lay down any
general rules on the* subject. Persons who were accused of tres-
passes to the vert which were too large for it to try were attached
in it to appear before th'e justices in eyre of the forest. In the matter
of venison it had no judicial functions at all, and pledges were not
found in it by trespassers for their appearance before the justices in
eyre as was the case in trespasses to the vert. In the forest of
Sherwood‚ and probably in the other forests north of the Trent, the
price of beasts forfeited for being in the forest in forbidden places or
at forbidden times, and also the price of wood felled or carried away
by trespassers were paid to the verderers in the court of attachments‚
for them to keep until the next forest eyre. No doubt, too, other
small ministeria] duties, varying in the different forests‚ were per-
formed in the same court.

Before leaving the subject it should be noticed that in some
forests the courts of attachments were called swanimotes. There is ‘²
a roll of attachment courts held in the forest of Cliffe in the early
years of the reign of Edward ΠΙ. in which the proceedings of each
court are styled ‘ Swanimotum tentum apud Cliue die Mercurii etc.'
There can be no doubt that these courts were attachments. They
were held every forty-second day, and they were concerned with the
same matters as were the attachment courts which were held in the
forest of Sherwood. Nor should we suppose that this was an isolated
practice. We have seen ³ that Peter de Neville appropriated to hirn-
self pleas of thomis, hazels and such like small vert in the forest of
Rutland‚ pleas which would certainly be held in the attachment courts
in any other county. But the entry from which we learn of this

longed to the chief forester and those of
large ones to the king. It was found by an
inquisition held in 1266 that small thorns
in this forest were those which could not
be pierced by an auger called a ‘restauger ⁷
(see p. 122 below). On another occasion
certain jurors gave the following answer to
the question how the division was made
between thorns belonging to the king and
the forester:

‘Dicunt quod ornnes forestarii qui
faciunt attasliiamenta in foresta iurati sunt
domino regi de fidelitate et cum uenerint
corani senescallo ad swaniniotuin et ibi

factum utrum spine fuerint pertinentes ad
(1011111111111 regem uel ad forestarium, et cuni
dicunt ad regem, tunc senescallus placitat
illud placitum ad opus domini regis; et si
dicunt quod ad forestarium, tunc idem
forest-arius placitat illud placitum ad opus
suum.’ (Rotulz' Hundreclorum, i. 26.)

The steward here mentioned was the
wal-den of the forests between the bridges
of Stainford and Oxford‚ and the forester
was the for-ester in fee of the forest of Bern-
wood (see p. xvii above).
