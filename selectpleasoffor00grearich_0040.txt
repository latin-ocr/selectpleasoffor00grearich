of the forest north of the Trent, for the benefit 01 1110 county of
Nottingham, and even if they intended it to apply to the other
northern counties‚ they had no power to extend it to the counties
south 01 1110 Trent. Its terms, too, are inadequate to explain the
law in many 01 the forests. The beech and the maple may
have been scarce in the county 01 Nottingham, but they grew in
abundance in many districts, and the ordinance does not tell us
whether the trespasser who took them in the forest could be punished
in the court 01 attachments‚ or could only be attached to answer for
his trespass in the court of the cyre. Nevertheless, in its broad
outlines it probably declared the law¹ which obtained on both sides
01 the river Trent, even though it fails to supply us with certain
details 01 some importance.

Attachment court rolls, consisting as they do 01 constantly
recurring entries 01 a few particular forms, are 01 little interest. The
following extract from an account2 rendered at the Exchequer in
the year 1316 shows the nature of the proceedings enrolled upon

them :

The following extracts from the accounts 01 other attachment
courts held in Sherwood forest in the same year are among the few
entries which are of a different nature from those occurring in the

account of the court printed above.
