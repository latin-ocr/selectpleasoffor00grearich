lxxii INTRODUCTION

the roll which we now possess, and sometimes in a slightly different
language. We have already seen that there were two records¹ of the
same series of inquisitions held in the forest of Huntingdon. If, how-
ever, there were other records of special inquisitions held in the forest
of Rockingham in the years 30 to 34 Henry ΠΙ. they were not used
as a basis for the eyre rolls.

There is one important point to be noticed about the Rockingham
roll of special inquisitions of 30 to 34 Henry ΠΙ. We have already
described its contents and have counted the numbers of inquisitions
and memoranda recorded in each year. If these be added together,
it will be found that it contains fifteen inquisitions and four
memoranda, or nineteen entries in all; whereas there are only
thirteen consecutive entries on the eyre rolls which correspond to
these entries on the roll of special inquisitions. Thus there are six 2
entries on the roll of inquisitions to which there are no corresponding
entries on the eyre rolls. These six entries are not consecutive but
are dispersed among the other inquisitions and memoranda. On the
other hand, to every entry on the Huntingdon roll of special inquisi-
tions there is a corresponding entry on the Huntingdon eyre rolls.

The difference between the two cases is probably accidental. We
have already noticed that the eyre rolls contain no information which
does not lead to a fine or an amercement. Thus, as we have seen,3
we are told nothing of a forest inquisition unless the townships are
amerced for not coming fully; nor are we told anything of the
imprisonment of a poacher, unless the sheriff failed to produce his
wal-rant for releasing him to pledges or the pledges failed to produce
him before the justices in eyre. In the same way it would be quite
unnecessary for an enrolment to be made of the proceedings in any
trespass if the justices were satisfied that the townships came fully;
if the sheriff duly produced his warrant for the release of a prisoner to
pledges ; if all the incidental requirements of the laws had been duly
observed, and if, in addition, the trespasser had died and his death
had been duly proved. As trespassers often died before the justices
came to hold a forest eyre, the absence of any entries on the eyre rolls
corresponding to six particular entries in the Rockingham roll of
special inquisitions of 30 to 34 Hemy HL, can be most easily
explained by there being no amercements in the particular cases of
any person or township for defaults‚ and the trespassers themselves
having died before the date of the eyre.
