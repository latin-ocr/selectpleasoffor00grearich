It happened on the Thursday³ next before the feast of Saint
Margaret, in the thirtieth year of the reign of king Henry, that, when
William, the walking forester in the park of Brigstock, entered his
bailiwick of the park, he found Hugh Swartgar, the reaper of the town of
Brigstock, leading two mastiffs-to wit, one white and the other red—
against the prohibition of the foresters. And a certain man of Brig-
stock, who was called Henry Tuke, went with the reaper. And when
he saw them, the said William wished to attach them, on account
of the dogs which they led so late in the park of the lord king. And
they refused to allow him to attach them. And the said William
the forester went into the town of Brigstock steasthily, and again
returned to the place where he had seen them before3 and he saw
them a second time in the same place. But when the aforesaid Hugh
and the aforesaid Henry Tuke saw the forester coming towards them,
they forthwith turned and fied, and he could not take them. And
the said William the forester went into the town of Brigstock and
sought for William, the clerk of the abbot of Cirencester‚ and Henry
the reeve 01 Brigstock‚ so that they might come with him and see
what the men did there. And they went with him, and found in the
same place where he had seen them before five snares 01 horse hair,
which the said Hugh and Henry Tuke had placed there for taking
fawns or hares. The said William the forester informed the verderers

men were put by pledges until the coming of the justices of the forest.

These are the names of the pledges 01 Hugh Swartgar :—Geoffrey

of Adam, Henry the son of Richard, Henry the son of Gervais.
