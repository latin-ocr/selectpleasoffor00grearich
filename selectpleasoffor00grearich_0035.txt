THE LESSER COURTS OF THE FOREST.

Manwood’s Arrangement and. the swanimote.

WHEN Manwood wrote his treatise on the ‘ Forest Lawes,’ traditione
of them may have survived still, although, as a body, they had
fallen long since into desuetude. Various rights and privileges
01 which we in the nineteenth century can learn little may have been
enforced in his day, but they could not have contributed much towards
the elucidation of the broad outlines 01 0111 subject. In the main his
knowledge 01 1116 forest laws, like ours, was derived 110111 official
records, and not from direct experience of their application. For this
reason we ought to attach little weight to his assertions where they
are deductions only from documents to which we also have access. It·
the Charter 01 1116 Forest had been issued for the first time in
the reign 01 Ε11Ζ6116111, Manwoed’s opinion on its construction might
have been interesting and even valuable. But issued 66 11 was 111
1116 reign of Henry HL, we should, if we desire to ascertain its
effect, use the methods 01 construction 01 the thirteenth century. So,
too, we should consider 110117 161 1116 political events and conditions of
that time perinitted the strict observance 01 116 provisions. And
above all we should renieniber that 11 1176 have evidence of the way in
Which it was obser-ved, its intended construction is interesting to the
historian so far only as it throws light upon conditions which pre-
vailed before its issue.

Manwood’s account of the forest courts needs revision. After
studying the Charter 01 1116 Forest he arrived at the conclusion that it
provided 101 06116111 judicial sessions 61 particular times. Fron] this
he assumed that those sessions were actually held. ‘ First‚’ he says‚¹
‘ it is to be understood that there be three principal and chief courts
usually kept 101 matters 01 1116 101661, that is to say, the court of
attachmentS‚ the court of 61161111110166,2 and the high court ³ 01 1116 Lord

on the Carte Antique Roll Ε Ε. 01 37. ’
³ The court which Manwood described

18¹¹? Forest Lawes, ed. 1615, chapter xxi. p.
v0.

² The letter 2· in the word swaniniote pro-
bably represents the syllable qe. in ‘ gemote.’
Swaniinotes are seldom mentioned in docu-
ments earlier in date than the Charter 01
the Forest. One 01 1116 earliest instances
01 116 1166 16 111 1116 0116116101 6 December

7 1189 to the monks 01 Peterborough recorded

as the Court 01 Justice seat was derived
from the court 01 1116 justices in eyre 101
picas 01 the forest which is described on
pp. l to lxxv below. The phrase ‘justice
seat ’ was not in use in the thirteenth cen-
tury.
