to the warden, unless there was an
order to the contrary. In this case the
word ‘frondes ' is used instead of
⁶ cop01·(nes,’ as if the latter were con-
sidered inappropriate.

The word ‘robur' was certainly not
used to denote the mere stumps of
trees, for in a verderer's roll of 38 Heu.
iii. we have ε

De cablici03 de uno robore uento

prosltrato (For. Proca, Tr. of Rea, 249,
ΕΟΖ 26).

Although ‘ robora ² were usually given
for fuel, there are instances of gifts for
other purposes, thus :

de pomeriis et ueteribus roboribus
quantum necesse fuerit ad perficiendum
rotas molendinorum regis . . . . et alia

minuta ad molendina illa pertinencia
(Close R01266,1m. 20».

sex robora ad scindulas faciendas
(ibid. m. 15).

In the roll from which the last extract
is taken, the words ¹ de quercubus
datis ’ are written in the margin.

On a Northamptonshire forest roll of
the year 1338, the form ‘ rouere ’
appears instead of ‘ robur ’ (For. Proc„
Tr. of Rea, No. 102).

rusca (M. F. ruche), a hive. Thus:
ignem secum portauerunt et ruscam

apum cremauerunt et mel inde asporta-
uerunt et unam quercum combiuerunt

(For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, 83, m. 4).

sequilones. This word seems to have
denoted dry wood. In the Huntingdon
forest eyre rolls of 1278 we have :

et eciam clamat sequilones in haiis
predictis que possunt colligi a manu
sine utensili ferreo (For. Proc.‚ Tr. of
Rea, No. 44, Rot. 5 d).

Again in an inquisition held on 8 July
1251 the following passages occur :

Homines domini regis de Clyue et de
Apetorp . . . consueuemnt habere secu-
lones iacentes super terram quod mani-
bus suis colligere poterunt.

Homines de Geytington habuerunt

. . siccum quod iacuit per terram quod
colligere possent manibus suis sine

armis emolitis (Inquisitionpost mortem,
35 Hen. iii. No. 61).

sewel (p. 131). An English word mean-
mg a scarecrow.

Anythyng that is hung up is called a
sewel. And those are used most com-
monly to amaze a Deare and to make
him refuse to pass wher they are

hanged up (Turberville, Book of Hunt-

inq, ed. 1575, p. 98).
sorbauzwan (p. 115), a sorel horse with
white feet. The corresponding com-
pound word in modern French is saure-
bulzan. Littre defines ‘ balzan' thus :
adj. m. Terme de manege. Cheval

balzan, cheval noir ou bai, qui a des
marques blanches aux pieds.

And ⁴ saure ’ :
adj. D'une couleur jaune qui tire sur
le brun3 ne se dit gnere qu’en parlant
des chevaux. Un cheval saure.
The word occurs in the Close Roll of
10 Ed. ii.‚ thus:

Sorus bauzanus dextrarius (close
Rozl 139, m. 30).

sorellus or zoreuus, a sorel. Manwood
calls a buck of the third year a sorel;
but ⁴ sorellus ’ in the thirteenth cen-
tury was applied both to the red deer
and the fallow deer. Thus in the Not-
tingham eyre rolls of the year 15 Ed. i.
(For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, 127), we have
‘ zorellus cerui ’ on one roll (Rot. 3) and
‘ zorellus dami ' on another (Rot. 5).

sorus, a soar. Other forms of this word
are ‘coerus' (p. 27), ‘zourus’ (p. 93),
‘ yourus ’ (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea„ 82),
and ‘ szourus ’ (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea,
No. 12, Rot. 4 cl). Manwood (Forest
chwes, p. 43 νο) states that the soar is
a buck of the fourth year. The word
was undoubtedly so used in the six-
teenth century and perhaps earlier3 but
in the thirteenth century it was applied
to the hart as well as to the buck, for
more than one instance can be cited of
the words ‘sourus cerui ’ (pp. 93, 105).

stablia (pp. 34, 44, 99), a besetting of a
wood for the purpose of taking deer or
other beasts. Other forms of the same
word are ¹ stabilea‚’ and ‘ stablea.' The
besetting might be made with men,
nets, greyhounds, sticks and otherwise.
The following examples illustrate some
of the methods employed :

Faciunt stabileam inter hayam dc T.
per unam leucam et dimidiam cum
retibus (For. Proc„ Tr. ofRec.,279, sicin
7 d: Cannok Fore-st, 39 Ed. iii).
