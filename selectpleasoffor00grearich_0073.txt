THE FOREST EYRE lxv

the proceedings of this eyre before they were actually concluded. It
certainly was the usual practice for all or nearly all the fines made
in this way to be enrolled as part of the record of their respective
cases, and not be enrolled separately as in the rolls of the Northamp-
tonshire eyre of 1255.

The justices in eyre were appointed to hear and determine pleas of
the forest. But in the reign of Henry HI. imprisonment for a defi-
nite period1 was an unknown punishment. Men were detained in
prison either to secure their appearance on some particular occasion,
or in order that they might pay a ransom for their release. The
pleas of the forest, therefore, could hardly be said to be determined
until the prisoners had been ransomed. It is probable that, with rare
exceptions, the prisoners made fine with the justices before they left
the place where the imprisonment was adjudged. The words ‘ being
brought out of prison‚’ which often preceded the words ‘ made fine'
in the enrolment, seem to show that the assessinent of the fine was a
matter which required the prisoner to be before the justices for the
purpose. It is most unlikely 2 that a prisoner would be taken out of
his gaol in one county to make fine with the justices when they were
engaged in hearing pleas in another county. We find, moreover, no
trace in the eyre rolls of any such a course being adopted.

The system of ransoming prisoners was not carried out oppres-
sively. The mere fact that there were as many as four justices was a
protection against the extortion which might have been practised by
a single judge. There certainly seems to have been no gross inequality
in the punishments which they imposed. Heavy ransoms were, 011
1116 whole, rare3 but, as faras it is possible to judge, they seem to
have been imposed with good reason. John Lovet, for instance, who
was ransomed for twelve marks at Northampton in 1255, no doubt
had to pay a heavier ransom than most of his fellow prisoners. But
he was a man of good family, and probably a knight.³ Moreomr,
being a verderer, it was only proper that he should suffer an exemplary

¹By article 9 of the Charter of the
Forest a man might be imprisoned for a
year and a day. The article is as follows:

‘Nullus de cetero amittat uitam uel
membra pro uenacione nostra; set si 'ali-
quis captus fuerit et conuictus de capcione
uenacionis‚ grauiter redimatur, si habeat
unde redimi possit ; et si non habeat unde
redimi possit iaceat in prisona nostra per
unum annum et unum diem; et si post
unum annum et unum diem plegios
inuenire possit, exeat a prisona; sin autem,

abiuret regnum Anglie.‘

Trespassers in pai-ks might be imprisoned
for a year and day. As to this see pp.
cxix-cxxi below.

² It is possible, however, that in some
cases the justices left a county before
assessing the 1611601116, and returned for
that purpose a short while afterwards.

³ He and his fellow verderers are de-
scribed as ‘domini’ on p. 100 below. See
