THE LESSER coURTs OF THE FOREST xlvii

information on this point may be derived from the records¹ of the
forest of Windsor, which was situate partly in Surrey and partly in
Berkshire. It seems to have been usual for the justice to hold two
inquisitions on the> same day, one concerning the Surrey portion of
the forest, the other concerning the Windsor portion. The first
column of the following table consists of the dates of all the recorded
inquisitions between the years 1363 and 1375; the second, of the
places at which they were held; and the third, of the numbers by
which the records of them are now cited.
