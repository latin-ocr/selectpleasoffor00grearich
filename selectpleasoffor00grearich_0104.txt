it might seem fitting to our council to do.'

It is a matter of doubt whether perambulations were made in the
years 1218 and 1219 111 all those counties in which there were foreste.
But if they were made, they seem to have been considered unsatis-
factory. For in December 1215) seven sets ofjustices were appointed ¹
to inquire in seven groups of counties respectively what forests ought
to be disafforested. The letters sent to the justices were compre-
hensive, and differed in form and substance from those by which
justices were appointed in subsequent perambulations. They began
as follows :

Rex Sarr’ episcopo salutem. Sciatis quod constituimus uos una cum
uenerabili patre Ι. Βο1011’ episcopo et dilectis et fidelibus nostris comite
Sarr' uel illo quem idem comes 1000 0110 ad hoc posuerit et Willelmo Briwer’
et Willelmo de Neuill’ ad inquisicionem faciendam in comitibus Dors’ et
Sumers’ et Wiltesir’ que foreste afforestate fuerunt per dominum I. regem
patrem nostrum et qui bosci positi fuerunt per eundem imfra regardum et
prius fuerunt extra regardum et similiter qui bosci positi fuerunt per eundem
in defensum ; et quas forestas uicecomites et castellani et alii bailliui nostri
tenent preter forestas quas forestarii de feodo tenent; et que foreste
afforestate fuerunt per Henricum regem auum nostrum tempore Alani de
N euill’ uel tempore aliorum forestariorum suorum de uoluntate ipsius regis
uel de uoluntate aliorum forestariorum suorum.

The letters then directed the justices to (11001101001 forthwith the

the forests might be disafforested if the report were satisfactory. It is
probable that the justices disafforested certain districts which had
been afforested by king John, and that the council was dissatisfied
