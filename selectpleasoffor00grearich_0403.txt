dare to attach any evil doer in his demesne wood, unless it be by a
sworn forester. After harvest the riding foresters come and collect
corn by the bushel‚ sometimes two bushels, sometimes three bushels,
sometimes four bushels, according to the people's means3 and in the
661116 way they make their ale, as do the walking foresters, to the great
grievance of the country.

This is the presentment of the forest of Mendip of their grievanceS.

7. Although the charter says that no swanimotefhenceforth is to
be held in the realm, except three times a year, to wit, at the beginning
of the fifteen days before the feast of St. Michael, when the agisters
meet to agist the demesne woods of the king, and about the feast
01 St. Martin‚ when the agisters ought to receive the king's pannage,
and that at these two swanimotes the foresters, verderers, agisters,
and none other shall come by distress, yet the chief forester comes
and causes all the free tenants within the forest to be summoned to
come before him, and from each town four men and the tithing man,
and if they do not come they incur defaults to the great grievance of

quests, although there is no beast dead or maimed, nor any lawful
indictment by a forester or any other certain man according to the
assize of the forest.

8. Although the charter says that no forester who is not a forester
in fee rendering farm to the king for his bailiwick ought to take any
, chiminage in his bailiwick‚ yet the foresters of Mendip and of Selwood
in Somerset render no farm to the king nor take chiminage, but they
take worse, Whereby the country feels itself aggrieved, without the king
having any profit, for it 16 outside his demesne ; for they attach every
man, rich and poor, dwelling within the forest with dead wood and with
dry wood; and from the poor they take, from every man who carries
wood upon his back six pence, and from the rich as much as they have
