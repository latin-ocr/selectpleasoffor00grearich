THE FOREsT Ernn liii

125} they were at Oxford ¹ hearing pleas of the forests of Whichwood
and Shotover and that part of the forest of Bernwood which lay in
Oxfordshire.

Three days after their arrival at Oxford William le Breton and his
colleagues were appointed 2 justices in eyre for pleas of the forest in
the counties of Berkshire, Rutland and Essex3 and on the same day³
letters close were addressed to the sheriffs of Essex, Rutland, Berk-
shire and Surrey in the same form as those which were sent to the
sheriff of Huntingdon on the lst June of the preceding year. As
there was but one forest in the counties of Surrey and Berkshire,
frequently called the forest ‘¹ of Windsor‚ it is improbable that the king
ever intended a session in eyre to be held in one county and not in the
other. There can be little doubt, therefore, that the word ‘ Surreia ’ was
accidentally omitted from the enrohnent of the letters patent of the
281211 J anuary‚ more especially as letters close were, as we have seen,
addressed on that day to the sheriff of Surrey as well as to the sheriffs
of Essex, Rutland and Berkshire.

So far the eyre rolls have enabled us to state positively the days
on which the justices began their sessions in the different counties
which they visited. At the head of the first eyre roll of each county
we have some such words as ‘Pleas5 of the forest in the county of
Huntingdon on the quinzaine of the Holy Trinity in the thirty-ninth
year of the reign of King Henry the son of King John before William
le Breton . . . . justices itinerating for pleas of the forest in the
county of Huntingdon’ But as the rolls of the eyre of Williarn 16
Breton and his fellows in EsseX, Berkshire and Surrey no longer
exist, it is impossible to trace their movements through these counties
with any precision. We know, however, from the rolls6 of the Rut-
land eyre that they were holding pleas in Rutland on the l2th June
1256; and an entry ⁷ on the same rolls shows that they intended to
