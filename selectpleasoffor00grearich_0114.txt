cvi INTRODUOTION

But the boundaries which had been settled in the Parliament of Lin-
coln were not easily set aside in this way. Edward Π. was compelled to
consent to the disafforestments which his father Edward I. had allowed
but afterwards revoked. His son Edward HI. was made ¹ to grant that
the Charter of the Forest should be kept in every article ; that the
perambulations which were ridden in the time of king Edward his
grandfather should be kept in the form in which they were then ridden
and bounded ς that thereupon a charter should be made to every shire
where it was ridden 3 and that in such places where it was not ridden, it
should be ridden by good men and lawful‚ and a charter thereupon made
as is above stated. The case of Surrey was exceptional. There had been
no disafforestment in this county, because the jurors of the perambula-
tion made on 5 March 1300 in pursuance of the letters patent of 27
September 1299 had found2 that no part of the forest ought to be
disafforested, and therefore no perambulation was made pursuant to
the letters patent of 1 April 1300. Accordingly the men of Surrey,
alleging that there had been no perambulation in the time of Edward Ι.
demanded that one should be made pursuant to the grant of Edward
ΙΠ. Letters patent were issued; a perambulation was made3 and the
whole county 01 Surrey was found to lie outside the forest. The king
formally disafforested3 the county on 26 December 1327. Six years
later he ordered ⁴ that the forest should be kept by the same boundaries
as in the time of the late king, notwithstanding the grant which he
had made in the first year of his reign, as he understood from divers
inquisitions taken in the time of his progenitore and from other
memoranda in the exchequer that divers woods and open spaces in
the county of Surrey ought to be afforested.

The perambulations made at the end of the reign of Edward Ι. are
of great value in so far as they show what the boundaries of the forest
were during the fourteenth and subsequent centuries. But except in
a few cases they do not assist in determining the boundaries of the
thirteenth century. In order to obtain information on this point, the
metes and bounds which are occasionally recorded on the eyre rolls ⁵
of the reigns of Henry ΠΙ. and Edward Ι. must be consulted. But on
the rolls of some forests they are not recorded, and in such cases the
