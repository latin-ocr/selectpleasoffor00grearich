THE LESSER counrs OF TnE FonEsT xliii
Now in the records¹ of the special inquisitions which still survive
we find nothing about the townships not coming fully. There can be
little doubt, however, that the question whether a township came
fully or not was never debated in the inquisition or at the eyre or
anywhere else. There are a few cases ² in the eyre rolls of a township
being amerced for not having come at all to the inquisition, ancl if
the corresponding records ³ of those inquisitions be examined, it will
be found that the failure to come at all is expressly mentioned in
them. Yet, as we have already observed, when the townships are
stated not to have come fully there is no corresponding statement in
the record of the inquisition. The explanation is that the not coming
fully was in certain events a presumption in law, which required no
proof‚ while the not coming at all was always a fact, which, if the
township was to be amerced for its default in the eyre, had to be
found by the inquisition. The presumption arose when the townships
could ascertain nothing about the matter for which they were assembled,
or not sufficient about it to satisfy the justices.

Although the passage which records the amercement was usually
in the form described above, we occasionally meet with other forms,
which seem to explain the reason of the amercement. Thus in the
Huntingdon eyre rolls of 39 Henry HL, we usually have:

And an inquisition was held by four neighbouring townships, to wit

..... who could ascertain nothing thereof‚ and because the townships
did not come fully, therefore they are in mercy.⁴

As the inquisitions by the townships are nev ei mentioned on the eyre
rolls except when they are amerced for not coming fully, and as the
finding that they could ascertain nothing is the only one which is ever
mentioned in connection with the not coming fully, we might assume
that the statement of the not coming fully depended on the failure to
ascertain anything, even if we had no other proof that it did so. It
is significant too, that we never find that some only of the four town-
ships are amerced for not having come fully. Either ⁵ all of them are
amerced or none of them.

¹ Records of special inquisitions of the
reign of Henry iii. are printed on pp. 69
to 116 below. In only one inquisition,
namely that of the 22 August 1255, is
there a statement that the townships
came fully and it will be observed that
this inquisition was held after the justices
in eyre had begun their session. It was
probably an experiment on the part of the
townships.

² See examples on pp. 31 and 36 below.

³ See pp. 87 and 111 below.

⁴ Examples of this or similar expres-
sions will be found on pp. 13, 15, 18, 19,
21, 23, 28, 29 below. In the case at the
top of p. 22 it is not stated that the town-
ships had ascertained nothing3 but the
enrolment shows that they failed to ascer-
tain the name of one of the trespassers.
