v gistas, j paunam, et xxx cheuerones
(ibid. 542 b).

If these examples stood alone it might
be assumed that the word was applied
to a beam cut in a particular manner,
and having a specific use ; but this was
probably not the case, as will be seen
from the following passages on the
Close Rolls:
lx cheuerones escapulatos et de alio
maireno [sic] quantum opus fuerit ad

domum suam de W. reedificandam (Rot,
Lite. Claus. i. 224).

lx cheuerones et x frusta [sic] ad
pannas faciendas (Rot. Litt. Claus. i.
528).

uendere . . . cheuerones de alno ad
scalcofaga (Close Roll 66, m. 22).

When the king made presents oi
‘ cheuerones ³ the number granted was
always a multiple of five. On 26 July
1225 Hen. iii. sent letters close to the
foresters in fee of Savernake ordering
them to cause certain men of Marl-
borough to have ‘cheuerones’ for re-
pairing their houses. Most of the men
were to receive ten each, but some re-
ceived fifteen, and others larger mul-
tiples of five (Rot. Litt. Claus. ii. 53).

communiter (pp. 2, 3, 5). This word was
ocasionally used at the beginning of the
thirteenth century to qualify the word
‘ uillata ' 3 but towards the end of the
same century this usage had become
obsolete. Thus, when some official
transcripts were made at the end of
the reign of Edward i. of certain
documents of the reign of John, in
which the words ⁴ uillata communiter '
in an abbreviated form occurred fre-
quently, the transcribessfs read them
sometimes as ‘ coniunctim‚’ and some-
times as‘ conuicta.’ See For. Proc„ Tr.
of Rea, No. 249, mm. 1, 2, 13. In the
original rolls these words occurred in
lists of amercements of townships, some
being entered thus ⁴ de uillata de M.‚‘
and others as ‘de uillata de N. com-
muniter.'

coporones (pp. 67, 124), the crop or lop and
top of a tree. Usually the word was
applied to that part of a tree which was
not fit for timber, but sometimes the

smaller branches appear to have been
called ‘escaete’ When the king gave
an oak to anybody, the gift, unless there
was a direction to the contrary, was
understood to refer to the timber of the
tree only, and the rest was, as a general
rule, a perquisite of the warden of the
forest or of a forester in see. Thus it
was found by inquisition in the year
1289 that the warden of Sherwood
forest was entitled to have the bark
and ‘ couporones ' of oaks given by the
king from his bailiwick. In this case
there can be no reason to doubt that
the ‘ coporones ' included the small as
well as the large branches3 and the
same may be said of many other pas-
sages where the word occurs (see (3.9.
p. 60). Perhaps the words ‘cum
escaetis' were added to show that the
small branches on the side of the
trunk were to go with the branches
from the upper part of the trunk, the
word ‘coporones’ being applied to the
top and ‘ escaete ' to the lop.

copule, couples. Henry iii. frequently

made presents of ‘copule’ by letters
close, enrolled upon the Close Bous,
and although it is clear that the word
was applied to some kind of beam or
raster, its relation to ¹ cheuerones ’ is
at present uncertain. But ¹ cheuerones,’
was probably a general term which
included ‘copules The following are
examples of its use :

xl copule . . . ad firmariam . . . facien-
dam (Rot. Litt. ozans. ii. 86).

xx copulas iiij trabes et iiij pannas,
(ibid. ii. 86).

xl copulas ad reparacionem domitorii
sui (ibid. i. 528, b).

cheuerones ad xxx copulas et in haya
de la Lya eorbellos et alia necessaria ad
predictas copulas (Close Rozz 43, m. 6).

couere (p. 81). This word probably meant

brindled or streaked. It was applied
to hounds in forest documents. Some-
times it was used without another
adjective; thus:

cum tribus lepor-ariis suis quorum duo
erant couere et tercius albus (For. Proc„
Tr. of Rea, 83, m. 8);

and sometimes to quality an adjective,
