NORTHAMPTONSHIRE EYRE, ΑΒ. 1209 3

who was taken with a bow and a string in the forest. And it is said
that he is dead. John the son of Gerard and William of Chalcombe
are in mercy because they represented themselves to be pledges of
the aforesaid Walter3 and they were not.

The whole township of Newton is in mercy for the fiight of
Richard (116166, 111611 reaper, who was accused of a buck shot in the
short wood of Nassington, for which Henry the son of Benselin of
Newton was taken.

The foresters found in the wood of Nassington a doe with its
throat cut, and hard by they found Henry the son of Benselin lying
under a certain bush. And they took him and put him in prison.
He comes before the justices and denies that he ever knew anything
of that doe, except only that 116 went into that wood to seek his horse.
The foresters took him and led him to that doe. The foresters and
verderers, being asked if he were guilty thereof or not, say that they
do not think that he was guilty, but they believe rather that Richard
Gelee the reaper of Newton is guilty thereos, because he fied as soon
as he heard that the aforesaid Henry was taken. And because Henry
himself has taken the crosS‚ and is not suspected, and has lain for a
long time in prison, it is granted to him that he may make his
pilgrimage3 and let him start before Whitsunday; and if he return,
and can find pledges of his fealty, let him remain in the forest.

Thomas InkeL forester of Cliffe‚ found in the wood of 8111611011 a
certain place wet with blood, and he traced the blood in the snow as
far as the house of Ralph Red of Siberton 3 and forthwith he sent
for the verderers and good men. They searched 1116 house, and
in it they found the flesh of a certain doe; and they took Ralph
himself and put him in prison at Northampton‚ where he died. But
before his death, when he was in prison, he appealed Robert Sturdi
of 8111611011 and Roger Tock of the same town, because they were
evil doers to the forest together with him. And the foresters and
verderers searched the house of the aforesaid Robert, and in it
found the bones of deer; and they took him and sent him to
prison. And in the house of Roger Tock they found ears and bones
of wild beasts. And he was taken and imprisoned. Robert Sturdi
comes before the justices and says that the dogs of Walter of Preston
used to be kenneled at his house. Walter’s hunters ate the
venison whence came the bones; and Robert vouches tho aforesaid
Walter to warranty of this, and let him have him to-morrow„
