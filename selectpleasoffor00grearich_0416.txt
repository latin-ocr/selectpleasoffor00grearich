words ‘blettrones quercuum’ are not
uncommon. Thus, in an inquisition at
Hereford in 7 Ed. iii. we have ε

duas carectatas blettronum quercuum

precii sex solidorum (For. Proc.² Tr. of
Rea. 258).

plaustratum blettronum quercuum
precii decem denariorum quos cariauit
noctanter cum uno plaustro et sex
bobus (ibid).
On the other hand, the words ‘ blett-
rones fagorum ’ seldom occur, but we
may take as an example the following
passage from an inquisition at Salis-
bury in 46 Ed. iii. ε
duas sagas, precii ij sol’3 . . . duas
magnas sagas precii v sol'3 . . . xxiiij
bletrones fagorum precii vj sol’, viijd.

(For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, No. 310).
There can be little doubt that the
¹ blettro ’ was not a fully-grown tree, as
in the passage last quoted as well as in
the ordinance of William de Vescy of
15 Ed. i., and in other cases, it seems
to have been reckoned as of little value.
Moreover, it is never mentioned in sales
of timber.

The forms ‘bletro' and ‘blestro‚'
which occur on p. 68 above, are
less common than ‘blettro.⁷ It is
impossible in thirteenth century docu-
ments to distinguish between such
forms as ⁴ blectro ' and ¹ blettro.'

bouiculus cerui. As to these words see

uitulus bisse.

brachettus (pp. 5, 34, 99), a brach, a
hound which hunted by scent. In the
chronicle now called Gesta Henrici
(Rolls Series, vol. ii. p. 180), we have ε

Eodem die rex Anglie misit Sal-adino
lepor-arios et biaselietos, id est, odori-
sequos.

An example has already been printed
above, under the word berselettus, to
show that a bercelet was sometimes
described as a brach. Another example
is afforded by the following entry in
Testa cle Nevill :

Stephanus de Bello Campo tenet Cotes
de domino rege in capite per unum
brachetum cum ligamine (p. 18, b) ;

to which the corresponding entry in a
list of knights' sees of the years 1284-
1286 is as follows:

GLOSSARY

Nicholaus de Segraue tenet Cotes pro
uno feodo et pro uno berseleto cum
ligamine de rege.

In the Rotulus Misae of 14 John (cole,
Documents illustrative of Enqlz'sh His-
tory) the ⁴ brachetti’ are frequently men-
tioned as well as certain hounds called
berserecii. It is not clear from the rolls
whether these two words represented
hounds of different kinds, or whether
one of the words could apply to both
kinds. There is, however, an entry in
which ‘ brachetti berserez ' are men-
tioned (ibid. p. 253). Both ‘ brachetti '
and ‘ berserecii ' were under the charge
of ‘ garciones’ or grooms (ibid. pp. 239,
253). It is probable that the ‘berse-
recii ’ and the ‘berceletti ' were the
same hounds and were specially trained
braches. See also berselettus and
limarius.

In the sixteenth century the English
word ‘ brach’ was used as the bitch
of any kind of hound (see New Enqlish
Dict'ionary, sm. Brach) ; but there is no
evidence of the Latin ‘ brachettus ’
having been so used.

The ‘brachetti berserez ' were not
the only braches which were used for
particular purposes in hunting. In
some letters close dated 29 September
1275, we read of ‘ brachetti ceruericii ’
(Close Rozz 97, m. 5). An example of the
words ‘ brachettus deymeretus ’ has been
quoted above under berselettus. There
were also braches which were used for
fox-hunting.

In some letters close dated 1 Decem-
ber 1213 we have:

Mittimus ad te W. M. uenatorem nos-
trum cum quadraginta brachettis wul-
periciis et sex leporariis et sex garcio-
nibus et uno equo ad currendum. . .
ad wulpem (Rot. Litt. Glaus. i. 156).

Although in the reign of John the
‘brachetti’ were distinct from the
‘canes de mota‚' it is possible that at
a rather later period the ‘canes cur-
rentes‚’ which were probably the same
as the ‘canes de mota‚’ sometimes in-
cluded ‘ brachetti.’ On p. 99 above we
read of a person uncoupling some
braches from his pack.
