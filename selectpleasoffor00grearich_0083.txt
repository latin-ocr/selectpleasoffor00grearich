THE FOREsr EYRE lxxv

the verderers and foresters at this inquisition are separate present-
ments¹ among the pleas relating to the forest of Rookingham‚ but the
entry which corresponds to the second finding, and the third, which is
supplementary to the second, should be looked for among the pleas of
the venison of the forest of Chffe, relating as it does to evil doers in
the bailiwick of Morehay, which lies in that forest.2

V.
THE RE GARD.

ONcE in every three years an inspection of the woods within the
metes and bounds of the forests was or ought to have been made
by twelve knights chosen for the purpose. The inspection was called
by the author of the ‘Dialogus de Scaccario’ the ‘uisitatio3 nemo-
rum‚’ but it was commonly, even in the twelfth century, known
as the Regard. The duty of the twelve knights who were called
regarders⁴ was to find answers to a set of interrogatories entituled
the Chapters of the Regard. Although they appear to have varied
in form from time to time during the reigns of Henry IL, Richard L,
and John, they acquired a rigid form early in the reign of Henry HL,
which they retained throughout the reigns of the three kings who
succeeded him. At least three versions ⁵ of the Chapters have survived
