THE 01111161 xciii

in the county court; and 11 116 did not then come he was outlawed.
But in the fourteenth century, if either clerk or layman failed to
appear at the eyre on the first day, he was forthwith exacted in the
county court without any second day being given to him. It is for
this reason that we find no 61111166 01 mandates being sent to the
bishop on the 65116 10116 01 1116 reign 01 Edward HI.

Again the mere absence of 61111166 011 1116 65116 10116 recording the
delivery of clerks to the attorneys of the bishop is not proof that such
delivery no longer took place. In many of 1116 65116 rolls of the reign
01 Η611151 HL, there are no such entries ; yet we know that the bishops
used 10 appoint attorneyS, whose business it was 10 attend 1116 eyre
and demand the delivery of clerks convicted 01 trespasses against the
forest laws. There was, in general, no special object 101 enrolling
the delivery‚ and in spite 01 1110 silence of the rolls, 1116 practice may
have continued.

VH,
THE EXTENT OF THE FORESTS.

ΟΝ 6 November 1217, the infant king Henry ΙΠ. was made to
issue the 01161161ι 01 1116 Εο1661, which contained the following two
chapters respecting the boundaries 01 1116 1016616 :

Inprimis omnes foreste quas Henricus rex auus noster afforestauit
uideantur per bonos et legales homines ; et si boscum aliquem alium quam
suum dominicum afforestauerit ad dampnum illius cuius boscus fuerit,
deafforestentur. Et si boscum suum proprium afforestauerit, remaneat
foresta, salua communa de herbagio 61 61116 111 eadem foresta illis qui eam
prius habere consueuerunt.

Omnes autem bosci qui fuerunt afforestati per regem Ricardum 6111111Ε
culum nostrum, uel per regem Iohannem patrem nostrum usque ad primani
coronationem nostram, statim deafforestentur nisi fuerit dominicus boscus
noster.

The language of the Charter is notable. A forest was 6 district
which might include both woods and open country3 yet it was only
woods which were to be disafforested. Perhaps in some cases 1110
kings had afforested Woods in the neighbourhood 01 their 1016616 but
had allowed the open country which surrounded them to remain
exempt or partially 2 616111111110111111610166116116, It is probable‚ how-
