elossARY 1 51

(For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, No. 161,
Roll15).

tribulus. As to this word see bulso.

ualtrarius, ueltrarius or nantarius, a
1ewterer, a person in charge of grey-
hounds. This word occurs in some
letters close of 4 October 1205, thus :

Mittimus tibi R. et W. de R. ualtrarios

nostros cum undecim leporariis (Rot.
Litt. Clazcs. i. 53 b).

A few years later the following passages
occur on the Close Rolls:

Inueni duodecim leporariis nostris,

. . . et duobus ueltrariis, qui illos

custodiunt, racionabile estuuerium

suum, et leporarios pasci faciatis de
brenio auene (Rot. Lite. Claus. i. 99, b).

Tresdecim leporarios 011111 duobus
ueltrariis (ibid. i. 154).
Mandamus uobis quod . . . mittatis

. . . leporarios nostros, quos habetis in
custodia sua, cum ueltrariis (ibid. i. 157).

In an inquisition post mortem of the
year 1302, we have :
per serianciam inueniendi domino
regi quando uadit in Wasconiam unum
hominem uocatum nauti-ier ad ducendos
tres leporarios domini regis quousque
idem uautrarius perusus fuerit uno pari
socularum precii quatuor denariorum
(Inqpost mortem, 34 Ed. z'. No. 37).

The king had packs of buekhounds
and harriers, which comprised running
hounds (see canes currentes) and grey-
hounds. The fewterers who were con-
cerned with these packs were styled
‘buckhound fewterers’ and ι11611161·
fewterers ' respectively. Thus in some
letters close dated 25 July 1312 we
have:

Cum mittamus . . . W. de B„ Ι. L.
et R. L. eum duobus bernariis haericiis
et quatuor ueutrariis haericiis et
duobus bernariis daemericiis et duobus
ueutrariis damericiis et uiginti et
quatuor canibus haericiis et uiginti et
quatuor canibus daemericiis currentibus

et triginta leporariis ad pinguedinem
. . capiendam (Close Rolz 135, m. 31).

ualtri. These hounds are mentioned on
the Rotulus Misae of 14 John. They
were hounds of a distinct kind and
were not the same as the ‘leporarii.'
This is apparent from 1110 following
extract from the roll 2

In expensis xlj ualtrarioruni quorum
quilibet habet per diem ij den’ et
quatuor leporariorum quorum quilibet
habet per diem obolum et xv ualtrorum
et xxj canum de 111016 quorum quilibet
habet per diem obolum (Cole, Docu-
ments illuso-atine of Enqlislz History,
p. 231).

In some letters patent dated 20 July
1471. 6 certain Nicholas Key is de-
scribed as ‘ualettus ueltrorum nostro-
rum' (Pae. Rozz 527, m. 18). In the
corresponding writ of Privy Sea] he is
described as ‘yoman of our leesh’
(Writs of Privy scaz, Fila 834, No.
3235).

uermes (p. 65). This word seems to have
been used of vermin. In Rotuli
Parliamentorum, ii. 79, there is a
petition in which the following pas-
sage occurs:

Et habeant 0116066111 suam per totam
balliuam foreste predicte ad lepores
uulpes murilegos tessones et ad omni-
modas huiusmodi uermes.

The original petition was a schedule to
another petition to which the modern
reference is Ancient Petitions, No. 7822.
It appears that when the ‘ancient
petitions' were rearranged and indexed
the schedule was detached from the
petition to which it was sewn; and it
is now no longer 10 be found.

uerrus (p. 74). The meaning of this word
is very doubtful. It occurs in an
Essex inquisition as the colour of a

greyhound. It is possible that it
means streaked or brindled. But it
may well have been applied to a hound
of irregular marking in more than one
colour. It may have come through a
French form of the Latin ‘uarius‚' a
word which was used to describe the
colour of a horse in some letters close
of 4 December 1214 (Rot. Lite. Claus.
i. 180).

uitulus bisse, a hind calf. Manwood
applies the words ‘hind calf' to hai-ts
and hinds of 6 year old. The words
‘uitulus bisse ' occur in a forest
inquisition held at Farnham in
42 Ed. iii. (For. Proa, Tr. of Rea, No.
310, skin 18). Ι11 some letters patent
dated 10 May 1341 we have:
