xxxiv ¹ INTRODUCTION

demesnes by people who were not inhabitants of the forest, and not
merely in those cases where they were found felling oaks. The
reason of the greater severity waS, no doubt, partly because a tres-
passer who was not an inhabitant could have no customary rights to
bring him into the king's demesne for a lawful purpose, and partly
because his offence would usually be harder for the forester to detect ;
but it was more especially because the foresters had no power to
attach any person outside the forest.

There was another ministeria] duty which was performed in the
attachments held in the forest of Sherwood, the delivery of the price
of wood wrongfully cut in the king’s demesnes and of animals for-
feited for being in the forest in forbidden places or at forbidden
times. It seems to be certain that in this matter Sir William de
Vescy merely regulated the existing practice by his ordinance ; for the
entries of pleas of the vert held at the first eyre in Nottingham
after he issued it differ only in form ¹ from the enrolment of the pleas
of the vert in other forests North of the Trent at an earlier date.
They differ, however, both in form and substance from the entries of
pleas of the vert held in the forests South of the Trent, of an earlier
as well as of a later date. After this ordinance an account was ren-
dered at the Exchequer at irregular intervals of the amercements which
had been made in the forest of Sherwood since the last account of a
similar kind was rendered. With such amercements, being for the small
trespasses to the vert specified in the ordinance, the justices in eyre
had no concern. The amercements of all other offences to the vert
were made by the justices and entered on the eyre rolls. But from the
next eyre after the ordinance, after each entry2 we find the words
‘ wherewith the verderers are charged in their roll of the price of the
vert’ or others to the same effect. At the head of another of the
rolls³ of the same eyre, we have the words ‘of the price of the
vert‚’ and beneath it an account of the price of the vert year by year
from the time of the last eyre.

Now this was not the ordinary procedure south of the Trent. We
do not read of accounts being rendered at the Exchequer of amerce-
ments by the attachment courts. The king and his advisers may
have claimed them, and sometimes ⁴ successfully, but on the other hand
the wardens and foresters in fee no doubt sometimes made a suc-
