cases of which the justices took note, in considering the punishment ¹
in the eyre.

The practice as to enrolling special inquisitions probably varied in
different forests, and as we have but few records of them it is im-
possible to speak with any confidence on the subject. The rolls on
which they are recorded and which still survive contain besides the
inquisitions other memoranda relating to the venison. When a man
was taken in the act of unlawfully killing venison‚ the story of the
trespass is duly enrolled. When an archbishop, bishop‚ earl or baron
passed through the forest, he was entitled2 under the Charter of
the Forest to take one or two beasts. On the rolls3 of the special
inquisitions in the forest of Rockingham 101 1116 years 30 10 39

¹ The following entry occurs on the
Buckinghamshire eyre roll of 1256 ;

‘Presentatum est per eosdem 61 conuictum
quod . . . . una dama inuenta fuit in domo
W. A. 61 Ι. fratris eius de F. quan] damam
cognouerunt se cepisse cum quadam ma-

china ferrea. Qui W. 61 Ι. capti 61 1111661
fuerunt ad prisonam apud E. qui ibi iacue-
runt usque nunc. Et modo ueniunt, 61
quia non habent unde redimi possint nec
plegios inuenire possunt etc„ ideo remane-
ant in prisona per unum annum et unum
diem ; 61 postea 61 invenire possunt plegios
etc., sin autem abiurent regnum etc. Postea
quia pauperes 61 per prisonam in qua iacue-
runt per unum annum et dimidium et
amplius ualde debilitati sunt corporibus
suis condonatur pro rege transgressio sua
predicta.' (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, No. 2,
Roll 2.) See also p. lxvi below.

Forest of 6 November 1217 is as follows :

‘Quicunque archiepiscopus, episcopus,
6011166, 1161 baro transierit per forestam
nostram liceat ei capere unam uel duas
bestias per uisum forestarii si presens fuerit,
sin autem faciat cornari ne uideatur furtiue
hoc facere.’

In the charter of 11 February 122}

⁴ The roll of 1116101661616, if they had
one, would probably be kept by the warden
of the forest.

⁵ See pp. 74 to 79 below.

⁶ The following extract from this roll
should be compared with a corresponding
entry on the roll printed on p. 75 of this
volume:

‘ [Contigit die] dominica in ramis Pal-
marum quod cum forestarii domini regis
de Wauberge 61 forestarii de Sappele
[fecissent [uigiliam sub haya de Sappel'

factores cum lepor-ariis . . . . . sub haya
