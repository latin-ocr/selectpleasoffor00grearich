Boscus Henrici Hubaud apud Ippele uastatur de ueteri et iterum de nouo
per eundem; ideo ipse in misericordia et boscus capiatur. Postea uenit
dictus Henricus et finiuit tam pro misericordia quam pro bosco suo
rehabend03 uiginti solidos ; plegii Simon Leuelaunse et Nicholaus Nel.

When the, owner of a wood which he had wasted had made fine for
his amercement and for having his wood again, he was still bound to
pay half a mark at every forest eyre until the wood had grown into
its former state. These payments occur in the record of every regard
on the eyre rolls, thus ¹ :

De uastis boseorum de ueteri.

De Willelmo de Bello Campo comite War' pro ueteri uasto bosci sui de
Abbelynch' . . . . dimidia marca.

De sacrista de Euesham pro ueteri uasto bosci de Attelench . . . . dimidia
marca.

De Waltero de Kocesey pro ueteri uasto bosci de Lench Randolf . . . .
dimidia, marca.

When the wood has grown to the state in which it was before it

wasted the entry on the eyre rol-Is is usually similar to the
following 2 ς

Boscus Ricardi de Portesye apud Portes' uastatur de ueteri. Postea
protestatum est per uiridarios forestarios [et] regardatores quod boscus
predictus bene reuenit37 ideo idern Ricardus dat domino regi dimidiam·
marcam pro eodem bosco, ne de cetero presentetur in uetus uastum. Et
hoc regardatoribus preceptum est,

As already stated, some of the answers which were given by the
regarders were often not recorded upon the eyre rolls. Besides the
six paragraphs relating to assarts, purprestures and wastes, the only
answer which was usually recorded upon them was a list of persons
having greyhounds within the forest. A few records, however, of the
original regards presented to the justices in eyre have survived from
which we may learn the manner in which all the Chapters were
answered by the regarders. The original record ³ of the three regards
made in the forests of Cliffe and Rockingham in the years 34, 37 and
39 Henry ΠΙ. respectively is among the most interesting of those
which bave survived. It proves that the regal-ders were not bound
to frame their answers in striot accordance with the words of the
chapters. The fifth chapter 4 was as follows:
