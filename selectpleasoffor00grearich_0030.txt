xxii INTRODUOTION

of Somerset presented at an inquisition held in the year 127 7. They
complained of the chief forester or warden appointing more foresters
than were necessary for looking 011011110101051, and of his taking from
them money 101 appointing them3 of the foresters coming in the
month of August to collect corn from the inhabitants, of their mak-
ing ale with the corn, which they then compelled the inhabitants to
buy 3 01 111011· collecting from them lambs and young pigs; and 01 their
cutting down trees 101 fuel, and 01 taking chiminage where it was not
due. 11 0011 hardly be doubted that extortion such as this was more
resented by the masses 01 1110 11001110 111011 1110 restrictions 011 hunting
and woodcutting which constituted the main body of the forest laws.
But even if the grievances 01 1110 111011 01 Somerset were exceptionaL
they were the same in kind as those which people suffered in all
the counties 01 England where the king had 1010515. Probably the
best known article 01 the Charter of the Forest was the one which
provided ε

Nullus forestarius uel bedellus de cetero faciat scotale uel colligat garbas
uel auenam uel bladum aliud uel agnos uel porcellos nec aliquam collectam
faciant ; et per uisum et sacramentum duodecim reguardorum quando facient
reguardum, tot forestarii ponantur ad forestas custodiendas quod ad illas
custodiendas racionabiliter uiderint sufficere.

But it was a difficult article to 01110100 ; and there was no better
safeguard against the evils which it was intended to remove than an
extensive disafforestment 01 1110 1010515.

So when the commons demanded that the perambulations of the
forest should be made in accordance with the provisions 01 1110 Charter
01 1110 Forest, their demand was largely one for a curtailment of
the districts over which extortion could be practised.

There were two kinds 01 101·051015; 111050 011 horseback, or riding
101051015, and those 011 1001, 01· walking foresters. The former were,
01 0011150, 111010 burdensome to the inhabitants 01 the forests than
the latter, but there was no rule as to how many foresters 01 00011
kind there should be in a forest. If, however, it appeared to the
justices in eyre that there were too many, they gave directions, ¹ as in
the case 01 Peter de Neville, that the number should be reduced.

Some 01 1110 101051015 0150 had grooms or pages under them, who
accompanied them when they were keeping watch over the forest.
They enjoyed no authority apart from their masters, to whom they
were related much as a ‘bulldog' is to a proctor in a university town.
