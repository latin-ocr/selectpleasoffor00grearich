considered as a particular kind of foresters rather than as a specially
created class of officers ; and that we meet with them only when the

whole system of forest administration was in a state of dissolution.

Regarders.

The (luties of the officers known as regarders are discussed on a
subsequent page under the general heading ‘The Regard.'

The Agisters.

The only remaining forest officere were the agisters, of whom there
were usually four in each forest. They were chiefly concerned with
the collection of money for the agistment of cattle and pigs in the king's
demesne woods and lawns. Beasts of the plough and sheep were allowed
to pasture over the lawns and open spaces in the forests, subject to
customary restrictions, but they were allowed in none of the forests
during the fortnights before and after Midsummer day respectively‚
a period which was known as the Fence Month or in Latin Mensis
Uetitu-u. They were excluded because the deer were supposed to
be fawning during this season. Pigs were agisted in the king’s
demesne woods from 14 September till about 11 November in every
year, and a few pence were paid for each pig agisted, the number
varying in different forests. The agisters counted the pigs as they
entered the forest, and collected the pence as the pigs came out. The
wardens seem to have appointed them, but there is at least one case¹
recorded of an agister being elected in the county court in the same
way as a verderer.

mentioned as officere attending the forest
inquisitions of the fourteenth century. In
one inquisition held in Braden forest in 12
Ed. iii. a man is described as ‘nuper rengi-
arius eiusdem foreste' (For. Proc„ Tr. of
Rea, No. 281, Rozl 4 'in dorso); in an in-
quisition concerning Wbittlewood forest,
held in 48 Ed. iii.‚ the following passage
occurs: ‘Item dicunt quod Almaricus de
sancto Amando senescallus foreste inter
pontes Oxon' et Staunford', qui non de iure
habere deberet neque de antiqua consue-

habet plures.’ (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, ⁴285,
Rozl 4.) And in another inquisition, held
in Brokenhurst in 40 Ed. iii„ it was found :
‘ quod ubi forestarii equites et due rangia-
tores dicte foreste solebant habere unum
hominem in foresta predicta, dicti forestarii
nunc habent tres homines ad nocumentum
patrie ad leuandum dicta amerciamenta
contra assisam foreste.' (For. Proc„ Tr.
of Rec.‚ No. 310.)
