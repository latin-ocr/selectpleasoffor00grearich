There can be little doubt that in some forests, if the procedure
was regular, certain ministeria] work was performed at the time when
the attachments were held. By the ordinancel promulgated by Sir
William de Vescy in January 128? it was provided that when anyone
dwelling within the forest -was found felling an oak‚ he was to be
attached to come 10 1110 next attachment, and there he was to find
pledges till the next eyre. If those pledges failed to produce him, we
may assume that they would be amerced and he would be again
attached by pledges. If on the other hand he was unable to find
pledges in the original instance, we may assume that the forester
would attach him by his goods and chattels instead of by pledges.
In these cases we can only assume what happened, because the rolls
of attaclnnents give us no information about the procedure which
regulated them3 but there is no reason to suppose that the process
to compel appearance in a forest court differed from that which was
used in cases 01 trespasses in ordinary manor courts.

When the trespasser appeared in the attachment, he found
pledges whose names were thereupon enrolled, but the enrolment
must have been made upon a special roll, as upon the rolls 01 0110011-
11101113 which still exist we find no entries relating to the pledges 101
the appearance 01 0 1103Ρο3301·’01 the next eyre.

The object 01 1110 finding 01 pledges on two occasions is not
difficult to understand. The pledges whom the 10103101· considered
to be sufficient to ensure the appearance of the trespasser at the
next attachment might be quite insufficient to ensure his appearance
at the next eyre, which might not be held 101· several years. Ob-
viously the decision as to who were to be accepted as pledges 101 1110
production of an offender at the forest eyre was a. serious matter,
requiring the presence 01 011 the parties interested and the con-
sideration 01 more than a single forest officer.

Where the trespasser was not an inhabitant 01 the forest, the
forester, instead 01 attaching him, was bound to send him to a prison
from which he could only be released by order of the king or the
justice 01 1110 forest. This, according to'the ordinance of Sir William
de Vescy, was the procedure in all cases 01 trespasses in the king’s
