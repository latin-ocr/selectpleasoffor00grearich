THE EXTENT OF THE Fonnsrs eiii
to be outside the forest; but it was sometime afforested, to wit, after
the first coronation of king Henry the grandfather of king Henry
the son of king John, by king John when he afforested all England ;
and it was afterwards disafforested by king Henry his son. King
John certainly prohibited1 fowling throughout England; he may
also have prohibited hunting in some counties3 but there is no
evidence that he ever afforested his whole kingdom.

In the autumn of the year 1297 Edward I. confirmed 2 the Charter

of the Forest. On 16 October in the same year, six justices
were sent3 to make perambulations of the forests both north and
south of the Trent; two being assigned to each of three groups of
counties. The letters patent, by which they were appointed, closely
resembled those by which Walter Scamel and Mathew de Colombieres
had been appointed in 1277, the word ‘perambulacio’ being again
qualified by ‘ scilicet, que facta tempore domini Henrici regis patris
nostri que nondum calumpniata fuit.' In the next month, however,
these letters patent were revoked4 and others issued, by which eight
justices were appointed to make perambulations, two being assigned
to each of four5 groups of counties. In the new letters patent the
word ‘ perambulacio ’ was not qualified as it had been before. Peram-
bulations seem to have been made by the justices shortly afterwards,
though perhaps not in all counties. An official record of the peram-
bulations6 made in Hampshire is preserved at the Public Record
Office and the perambulations⁷ which were made in Somerset are
recorded in a register of Wells Cathedral. Others may yet be found
in monastic and private chartularies.

As the boundaries of the forests had been settled with great care
in the early years of the reign of Henry HL, there was no reason why
they should again be changed. In spite, therefore, of the confirma-
tion of the charter and the resulting perambulations, the forests were
not reduced in size. But in the autumn of the year 1298 the king
