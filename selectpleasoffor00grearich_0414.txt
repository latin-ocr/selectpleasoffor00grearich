duobus bernai-iis duobus ueutrariis uno
bercelettario uiginti et quatuor canibus
currentibus decem lepor-ariis et duobus
bercelettis ad perhendinandum infra
balliuam tuam (Closs RoZZ 136, m. 7).

In the second example the word ί11000-
ken ⁷ corresponds to the modern ‘ chasse-
chien.’ There were different breeds of
running honnds, such as canes cerue-
ricii, canes damericii, canes haericii,
and canes lutericii. The berners at-
tached 10 0 pack of ‘canes damericii’
were called ‘ bernarii damericii‚’ and
those to a pack of ‘ canes haericii ' were
called ‘ bernarii haericii’; thus in some
letters close 01 7 January 131} wehave:

Cum mittamus . . . Ι. L. et R. L.
cum duobus bernariis haericiis quatuor
neutrariis uno bercelletario duobus
bernariis daemericiis et quadraginta et
octo canibus currentibus decem et octo
leporariis et duobus bercelletis ad.
capiendas quadraginta damas de ferme-
sona (Glose Roll 137, m. 22¹).

In 11110 case the forty-eight running
hounds must have consisted partly of
‘canes haericii ' and partly of ‘canes
damericii.’ See also the last example
under the word ualtrarius in this
Glossary.

The passages quoted do not of them-
selves prove that in the reign of Ed. ii.
the berners had no concern with the
greyhounds, but as we repeatedly find
fewterers in charge of the greyhounds
alone and never in charge 01 running
hounds alone, there can be little doubt
on the point (see ualtrarius, below).

In the reign of John, however, it
seems that berners were sometimes in
charge 01ί canes de mota ’ and braches.
Thus in some letters close 01 1 Sep-
tember 1212 we have :

Mittimus ad te 00 et xl leporarios
nostros cum lvj ualtrariis eorum custodi-
bus. Mittimus eciam ad te W. f. R, W.
V.‚ et R. de S. mandantes quatinus eis-
dem leporariis et ualtrariis et canibus no-
stris de motis et brachettis cum eorum

bernariis . . . necessaria inuenias (Rot.
Lm Glaus. i. 123).

The ⁴ canes de mota' were probably
the same as the ‘canes currentes.’

bersa (p. 2). There 10 considerable doubt
asto what this word means, but it seems

to be nearly synonymous with ‘ haya,‘

GLOSSARY

which may mean a piece of enclosed
ground or the fence which enclosed a
piece 01 ground. In a charter granted
by King John on 30 May 1205 the
following words occur ι

pasturam quadraginta uaccarum cum
uitulis suis (101100 habeant unum annum
et duorum taurorum per totam bersam
nostram in foresta nostra de Chipe-
ham (Rot. Cart. p. 152).

Again, in Testa de Nevill (p. 43, a), we
have :

Ricardus Strechte tenet duas uirgatas
per serianciam ad custodiendam bersam
domini regis in foresta in partibus illis.

The word also occurs in some letters
close 01 2 October 1216:

Mandamus uobis quod non permittatis
quod milites quibus uicecomes Norhamt¹
terras assignauit 10 foresta nostra
aliquid uendant de boscis ubi dominicas
chaceas et bersas nostras et defensam
nostram habere consuem'mus (Rot. Litt.

Claus. i. 290).

The words ‘cum bersa ’ on p. 98 are
perhaps an error for ‘ cum berseletto‚'
but they may mean ⁴ with the aid of an
enelosure.'

bersare (p. 65), to shoot. In Du Cange’s

Glossarium this word is translated by
‘uenali’ It certainly did not bear that
meaning in England in the thirteenth
century. Expressions such as ‘ bersa-
tum in femore dextro ⁷ (p. 87) are com-
mon; and no use of it which suggests
the meaning of ‘to hunt’ instead of
‘ to shoot ’ has been cited.

bei-satores (p. 10), although properly

meaning ‘persons shooting‚⁷ may be
conveniently translated as ‘poachers’

berselettus (p. 110), a bereelet‚ a hound

which hunted by scent. The word is a
diminutive of ‘ bersellus,⁷ which was
probably a bound of the same nature,
but of a larger size. In the Worcester
eyre roll of 1271 we have :
Idem R. habet quandam leporariam
sequentem ipsum per forestam, et cum
bersauerit aliquam feram, 1110 leporaria

sequitur illam feram quasi bei-seletus

quousque inuenerit et ceperit eam
(For. Proc„ Tr. ofRec., No. 229, Roll 7).

The bercelet was sometimes described
as a brach. In Testa „de Nevizz, the

following passage occurs ;
