declared in detail. The following is a translation of the first chapter
of the statute :

First we will and ordain for us and our heirs that with respect to all
trespasses hereafter committed in our forests, against our vert and venison,
the foresters within whose bailiwicks such trespasses may chance to be
committed, do present the same at the next swanimotes before the foresterS,
verderers, regarders, agisters and other ministers of the same forests, and
upon such presentments there, before the foresters, verderers and all other
ministers aforesaid, by the oath as well of the knights as of other good and
loyal men of the neighbouring parts where the trespasses so presented shall
have been committed, not being under suspicion, let the truth be fully in-
quired, and when the truth has been so inquired let those presentments be
solemnly confirmed by the common accord and consent of all the ministers
aforesaid and let them be sealed with their seals. And if*an indictment be
made in any other way, let it be held entirely void.¹

After the date of this statute general inquisitions were held at
frequent intervals in all the forests. The justice of the forest or his
lieutenant was invariably present, and the inquisitions were made
before him by the forest Officers and a body of jurors. An inquisition ²
was made at Guildford on the eth May 1363 concerning the state of
the forest of Windsor by the wardon, four foresters, five verderers,
twelve regarders and twenty-four free tenants within the metes of the
forest. Another inquisition,3 held at Wokingham on the llth July
1372, was made by the warden, eight or nine foresters, three verderers,
twelve regarders, two agisters, eighteen free tenants within the metes
of the forest and twelve free tenants without the metes. But a third
inquisition‚‘¹ held at Windsor on the 21st April 1366, was made by
the war-den, three foresters, four verderers, twelve regarders and twelve
free tenants, and also twelve more free tenants within and twelve
free tenants without the forest. In inquisitions held in other forests
about this time similar variations occur.

The general inquisitions, although sometimes called swanimotes,
were not held ,at the dates on which swanimotes were authorised to be
held by the Forest Charter. They were probably held at such times
as were convenient to the justice of the forest or his deputy. A con-
siderable number of records of such inquisitions held during the last
fifteen years of the reign of Edward ΠΙ. still exist. Many of them,
however, have been lost, and it is therefore difficult to say with any
precision at what intervals the inquisitions were held. But some
