RUTLAND Ernr„ An. 1269 >2

fully bound to give to him any chiminage‚ on the ground that the
ash trees which he was carrying were cut down in his own court in
the town of Empingham‚ which is outside the metes of the forest,
the same Thomas maliciously raised the hue upon the same Geoffrey
and distrained him till he gave him two shillings, and found pledges
to come to the swanimote. And when the same Geoffrey came to
the swanimote the aforesaid Peter took him and imprisoned him at
Allexton and afterwards released him for a fine of half a mark,
which he paid to him. And because it is proved that all this was
done unlawfully and against the assise of the forest, therefore to
judgment with the aforesaid Peter, and let the same Peter answer
for the money. And because it is proved that the aforesaid Thomas
the forester subjected the men of the parts aforesaid to much loss and
grievous extortions against the assise of the forest and against the
tenor of the chartei· concerning the liberties of the forest, therefore
the same Thomas is committed to prison, and he made fine elsewhere.
And it is ordered that in future there be no forester in the parts afore-
said, and that chiminage be not taken there against the tenor of the
chartei· aforesaid.

It is proved also that five walking forestem, to wit two in the
bailiwick of Beaumont, and two in the bailiwick of Braunston‚ and
one in the park of Ridlington, and one riding forester, together with
one page, are sufficient to guard the whole forest of Rutland, and that
more foresters ought not to be, nor of old were wont to be, in the
same forest. Therefore it is ordered that in future there be not
more foresters than the aforesaid five walking foresters and one riding
forester as is aforesaid.

And because the aforesaid Peter had many foresters under him in
the said forest, who had pages under them, to the damage and over-
burdening of the whole country, therefore to judgment with him.
And it is ordered that no walking forester in future is to have pages
under him in the forest.

The same Peter made a certain gaol at Allexton in the county
of Leicester, which is full of water at the bottom, and in which he
imprisoned many men whom he took lawfully and unlawfully by
reason of his bailiwick in the county of Rutland; and he delivered
many of them at his pleasure and without warrant. Therefore to
judgment with him.

And because in like manner it is witnessed that all prisoners, as
well on account of the forest as on every other account, taken in the
county of Ruti-and ought to be imprisoncd in the castlc of Oakham,
