ever, that the word ⁴ boscus' was not intended to be construed literally,
but was used loosely of districts which were assumed to be for the
most part wooded. Again, the woods which Henry ΙΙ. had afforested
were only to be disafforested when they had been afforested to the
damage of their owners. A qualification so vague as this was open
to very different interpretations by the king and the owners of the
woods. But more significant than the language of the Charter were
the actual conditions under which the disafforestments were to be
made. The woods which king Henry ΙΙ. had afforested were to be
viewed by good and loyal men, and there was to be no disafforest-
ment until they had been viewed ; but the woods which king Richard
or king John had afforested were to be forthwith disafforested and
no view of them was necessary.

Pursuant to the Charter letters patent1 were issued on 24 July
1218, directing perambulations of the forest to be made by twelve
knightS, elected for the purpose, by view of John Marshall, who was
then justice of the forest. A few of the perambulations still exist,
the following2 being one of them:

boundaries of the forests in December 1219
were directed to inquire what woods had
been put within the regard by king John,
and what woods had been put in defense
by him. (See Rot. Lm. olaus. i. 434.)
This direction points to the king having
partially afforested certain districts. By
putting woods within the regard, he pro-
hibited wastes and essarts. By putting
them in defense, he prohibited hunting in
them. The expression ‘ to put in defense'
seems, however, sometimes to have denoted
merely the exclusion of sheep and cattle
from pasture. See pp. 47, 48 below.

⁵ John Μαι-311011 was appointed justice
of the forest by letters patent dated
8 November 1217. (See Patent Roll,
17 m. 9.) At this time there was only
one 1ustice of the forest for all England.
