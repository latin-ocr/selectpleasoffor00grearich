If we examine the rolls of the eyres which were held about
40 Henry HL, we find that the amer-cement of the townships for not
coming fully was a common event in all the forests. We find it in
entry after entry and we may therefore assume that the special
inquisition was part of the forest procedure everywhere. If, however,
we examine the rolls of the eyres which were held about fourteen years
later,' we find that the townships were amerced less often for not
coming fully, and except in the early years of his reign they were
seldom amerced for this default during the reign of Edward I.
Now it is very improbable that the townships throughout England
during the reign of Edward I. became so careful that they always
ascertained facts in their inquisitions which were sufficient to satisfy
the justices in eyre, and it is even more improbable that the justices
gradually became more lenient to the townships and thus deprived
the king of a source of revenue. It is much more probable that
owing to some alteration in the forest procedure the special inquisi-
tion gradually ceased to be held. We shall see presently that this
was actually the case.l

The features of the special inquisition were, first, its purpose,
which was that of inquii-ing into some particular trespass or event
relating to the venison ; next its date, which was always soon after
such trespass had been committed or such event had happened;
and lastly the persons by and before whom it was held—namely‚ by
the four neighbouring townships and before the foresters and verderers

of the forest. Now there exists a roll of inquisitions which were held

one of four townships being amerced for possint.'

the other three townships being also Article 24 of the Provisions of Marl-

borquh of 1267 was in the following

amerced for the same reason. The editor
of this volume is not aware of any such

instance in other unprinted forest cyre rolls.

¹ The legislation concerning the aniel-ce<
ments imposed by justices in eyre for
pleas of the crown upon townships which
‹lid not come fully to make inquisitions
before the sheriffs or coroners is of some
interest in relation to the history of the
forest inquisitions. By article 24 of the
Proxdsions of Westminster of the year 1259
it was provided as follows:

‘Iusticiarii itinerantes de cetero non
amerciant uillatas in itinere suo, pro eo
quod singuli duodecim annorum non uene·
rint coram uicecomitibus et coronatoribus
ad inquisiciones de morte hominis aut
aliis ad coronam pertinentibus, dum
tamen de uillis illis ueniant sufficienter per
quos inquisitiones huiusmodi plene fieri

‘Iusticiarii itinerantes non amercient de
cetero uillatas in itinere suo, pro eo quod
singuli duodecin] annorum non uenerint
coram uicecomitibus et coronatore ad in-
quisiciones de robberiis et incendiis aut
aliis ad coronam spectantibus faciendas,
dum tamen de uillis illis ueniant sufficien-
ter per quos huiusmodi inquisiciones plene
fieri possint, exceptis inquisicionibus de
morte hominis faciendis, ubi omnes duo-
decim annorum uenire debent nisi raciona-
bilem causam absencie sue habeant.'

See Statzctes of the Realm, i. 25. In
the text printed in the Appendix to de
Antiquis Lenibus (Works of the Camden
Society‚ vol. 34, p. 233) the words ⁸ uiginti
unius ' occur in place of ‘ duodecim.‘
