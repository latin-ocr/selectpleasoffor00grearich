THE FOREsT EYRE lxxiii

The purpose for which our second roll ¹ of inquisitions was compiled
is not apparent. Although continuous in point of time with the earlier
roll, it does not seem to have been used in the same way as the basis
of a portion of the eyre rolls. There are several entries on the eyre
rolls, to which there are no corresponding entries on the roll of inqui-
sitions, and the entries which correspond with one another on the two
records are not in the same order. Moreover, there are facts stated
in the eyre rolls of which we find nothing in the roll of inquisitions.
Thus, on the eyre rolls it is stated 2 that two malefactors on 4 October
1251 took a certain Robert of Wick‚ the hunter of the justice of the
forest, bound him to an oak and afterwards permitted him to depart.
In the roll of inquisitions3 it is merely stated that two malefactors took
Robert of Wick, when he was standing at his post, and say nothing
further about binding him to a tree or permitting him to depart. This
may be a small variation, which admits of explanation, but the same
cannot be said of the inconsistent statements in the last entry on the
eyre rolls and the last entry on the roll of inquisitionS‚ both of which
clearly are intended to refer to the same events It should be noticed
also that there is a difference in arrangement between this roll of in-
quisitions and the earlier roll which we have already described. In
the earlier roll, the entries ⁴ relating to the venison taken by the king's
writ and the venison taken without warrant come after the inquisi-
tions and memoranda; while in the latter roll they occur among the
inquisitions and memoranda in chronological order.

It would seem, then, that some other roll of special inquisitions
extending over the years 35 to 39 Henry HL, which no longer exists,
was used as a basis for part of the Northampton eyre rolls of 1255.
Nevertheless‚ many of the inquisitions recorded on the roll which we
possess probably differ but little in substance from those which were
recorded on the roll which was actually used.

Perhaps the most interesting feature of the roll which has survived
is an inquisition ⁵ which was held before Sir Arnold de Bois, the justice
of the forest, on 2 October 1253. This is not a special inquisition
such as are the others on* the same roll. It is described as having
been made concerning evil doers in the forest by thirteen jurors and
five townships. Nor was it made about a particular trespass by par-
ticular evil doers. Probably it was an exceptional inquiry made in
consequence of some alleged misconduct on the part of the foresters
