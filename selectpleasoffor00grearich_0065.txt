THE FOREST EYRE lvii
counties only were visited by him. This, again, was probably owing
to political reasons.

There was one more eyre¹ in the reign of Henry III. The justices²
were Roger of clifford, Matthew de Colombieres, Nicholas of Romsey
and Reynold of Oakley. It began in the year 53 Hen. HL, and
continued to the end of the reign, extending over nearly all the
counties of England south of the Trent in which there were forests.
It was probably the death of the king, in 1272, which prevented the
justices from visiting the remaining counties. Thus it seems that in
the latter half of the reign of Henry HL, three forest eyres were held
south of the Trent at intervals of about seven years. The first began
in 39 Henry HL, the second in 46 Henry HL, and the third in
53 Henry ΠΙ. In some counties the interval was longer and in some
shorter‚ but it would seem that seven years was supposed to be the
proper interval between one eyre and another. It was a recognised
111163 that this was the shortest interval between successive eyres of
justices for pleas of the crown and common pleas ; and it is probable
that the holding of the forest eyre was considered subject to the same
limitation.

In the reign of Edward I. the eyres began to be held much more
irregularly ; thus there was one in Sherwood F orest in 1287, and not
another* until 1334. This was an exceptionally long interval, but
in all the forests the intervals became longer and longer.
