THE FOREST EYRE lv

01 Dean, pursuant to letters patent¹ dated the 15th December
1257.

We have now traced the progress of the justices through a group
01 thirteen counties. There remain four others, all lying south of the
river Trent, in which there were royal forests of considerable extent ;
1161116157, Staffordshire‚ Salop‚ Worcestershire and Herefordshire.2
William le Breton, however, and his fellows never held a session in
eyre in any of these counties. There are no rolls which record pleas
held by them there; nor are there any entries on the Patent and
Close Rolls, which relate to their appointment as justices. On the
other hand, by letters patent 3 dated the 3rd December 1261, 1116 king
appointed Alan la Zouche, Nicholas 01 Romsey and William 01 Powick
justices in eyre for pleas of the forest in the counties 01 Stafford,
Salop‚ and Hereford‚ and on the 15th February in the following
year he sent letters close ‘¹ to the sheriff 01 Worcester directing him to
summon all those who were wont and ought to attend the forest eyre
to come before the same justices.

The rolls 01 1116 101661 pleas5 held in the counties of Worcester
and Salop in the year 1262 pursuant to these letters patent still
exist, and, as they contain many pleas 01 1116 venison 01 an earlier
date than 1255, they show clearly that no eyre was held by William
le Breton and his fellows in either of these counties after they 1611
Gloucester in 1258. The same point is established in the case 01
Staffordshire by an official transcript6 01 1116 eyre of Alan la
Zouche in 1261, made 101 1116 1166 01 1116 king some forty years later.
In the case 01 Herefordshire the 10116 01 the year 1262, which might
establish in the same way that there was no eyre in that county in
1258, 110 longer exist. We may assume, however, that, as in the case
of Staffordshire‚ Worcestershire and Salop, there was no eyre in that
year.

There can be little doubt that the king originally intended
William le Breton and his fellows to hold forest pleas‚ in all the

Nicholao de Romes’, Galfrido de Leukenore Rutland respectively. It is probable that
iusticiariis itinerantibus ad placita foreste the pleas 01 1116 forest in Warwickshire
apud Gloucestr’ in octabis sancti Hyllarii were heard at Worcester, and those 01 the
anno quadragesimo secundo? forest in Leicestershire at Oakham.
