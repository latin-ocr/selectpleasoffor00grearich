but some letters close¹ dated 1222, and addressed to the sheriff of
Wiltshire show that by custom they were not liable to be put on
assizes, recognitione and jurieS. Although the number of verderers
in each forest varied, it was usually four3 sometimes, however, a
forest was divided into several bailiwicks, in each of which there were
four verderers. Thus, there were four in each of the three bailiwicks in
the forest*2 of Northumberland, and a similar arrangement prevailed
in the forest 3 of Cumberland, which also comprised three bailiwicks.
On the other hand, in Sherwood ⁴ forest the number of verderers was
six. F inally, a few foreste, among which may be noticed the forest of
Rutland ⁵ and the warren of Somerton,6 were considered too small to
need more than two verderers.

The chief work in which the verderers were engaged was that of
attending the forest courts.⁷

'I'he Foresters.

All the ordinary work of the forests, such as watching for tres-
passers, pursuing them, attaching or arresting them—in short, all the
work of a modern gamekeeper—was performed by a group of officers
called foresters, whose numbers varied in different forests. In the
Butland forest cyre of 1269, it was proved that Peter de Neville,
the warden, had under him many foresters with pages under them, to
the damage and overburdening of the whole country. Accordingly,
the justices directed that there should in future be no more than
five walking forestem, one riding forester and a page, the number
that of old there was wont to be. These foresters were not only

¹ The following is the text of theletters
close: ‘Rex uieecomiti Wiltes’ salutem.
Precipimus tibi quod non ponas uiridarios
nostros de foresta nost-ra de Braden’ in
assisis recognicionibus uel iuratis quia se-
cundum consuetudinem terre nostre poni
non debent in assisis recognieionibus uel
iuratis.⁷ (Rot. Litt. Clazts. i. p. 486.)

It seems from the following entry on the
Close Roll of 32 Hen. iii„ that the exemp-
tion did not extend to grand assizes:
· Mandatum est uicecomiti Berkes' quod non
ponat G. P. et R. F. in aliquibus assisis
preterquam in magnis assisis, si opus fuerit,
quamdiu iidem G. et R. fuerint uiridarii
regis in foresta regis de S.’ (Close Roll
62, m. 8. ι

² Froni the rolls of an eyre held at New-
castle on 22 April 1286. it appears that
there were three bailiwicks in the forest of

Northumberland. One lay to the south of
the river coquet, another between the rivers
Coquet and Alme, and the third to the north
of the river Alne. The same rolls show
that there were twelve verderers in the
whole forest. (See For. Proe., Tr. of Rec„
No. 125.

³ On >the rolls of the eyre held at
Cumberland in 13 Ed. i. thirty-six regarders
are mentioned; of whom twelve made a
regard in one bailiwick‚ and twelve in an-
other. No regard made by the regarders
of the third bailiwick is recorded on these
eyre rolls. (For Proc., Tr. of Rea, No. 5.)
The same rolls show that there were twelve
verderers in the whole forest.
