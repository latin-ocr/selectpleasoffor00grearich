number of orders from the king relating
to the fallen timber. It would seem
from these and other entries that in

· the thirteenth century ‘cableicium'

was used of trees and not of bianches,
but the point is not clear. The word
was still in use in the fifteenth century.
On 3 March 144} an inquisition post
mortem was held at Oakham on the
death of Anna Chiselden, and the
jur-ors found that she died seised in
her demesne as of see of the warden-
ship of the forest of Rutland‚ ‘una
cum wyndfallyn’ wode derefallyn' wode
cabliciis. . . .' Another form of the
word is ‘caplicium‚' which occurs in
some letters close dated 2 September
1315 (Close Roll 138, m. 25). Similarly
we have the form ‘caplecium’ in an
ordinance of 4 February 1233 (Glose
Rozz 49, m. 16 in dorso).

canes currentes, running hounds. Prob-
ably the earliest mention of these
hounds in our public records is in
some letters close dated 6 April 1205.
Thus,

Mittimus ad te R. B. cum octo lepo-
rariis et octo canibus currentibus et A.
cum octo canibus currentibus, man-
dantes tibi quod eisdem R. et A. facias
habere libel-aciones ad se et ad equos
suos, scilicet, cuilibet duodecim denarios
per diem quamdiu ibi erunt per precep-
tum nostrum uel quousque aliud man-
datum nostrum inde habueris3 et
leporariis facias habere cuilibet in die
unum obulum et aliis canibus currenti-
bus facias fieri brennum unde pascantur,
nisi die quo current et pascantur coriam,

ea die nichil habeant canes neque
leporarii (Rot. Lite. Glaus. i. 26).

011 the Rotulus Misae of 14 John the
following passage occurs:
Eidem H. ad inueniendas expensas
tresdecim canibus currentibus ad lepus
et tribus leporariis euntibus ad predic-

tum R. (Cole‚ Docunwnts illustrative
of Enylish History, p. 233).

This is the only case in the roll in
which ‘canes currentes’ are men-
tioned.

It is probable that the ‘canes cur-
rentes' included the hounds which
in the time of John were described
as ‘canes de mota.'

canes de mota. An example of the use

GLOSSARY

of these words occurs in some letters
close of 6 January 1223:

Mittimus ad vos A. E.‚ R. P. et A. de

N. cum uiginti canibus de mota et

duobus leporariis ad capiendum . . .
centum damos (Rot. Litt. Claros. ii. 12).

An earlier example occurs in letters
close of 29 August 1214:

Mittimus ad uos Gn, N.‚ W. et G.
uenatores nostros cum septem equis et
tribus bernariis et septem garcionibus
et xlviij canibus de mota, mandantes
quatinus eos· currere faciatis ad ceruos
et porcos inestiuatos (Boc. Litt. Claus.
i. 170).

The canes de mota are frequently men-
tioned on the ‘Botulus Misae’ of 14
John and also in a Wardrobe Account
of 18 Ed. i. (Accomzts, QR„ Bundle
352, No. 26). The ⁴ canes currentes '
are not mentioned in either of these
documents.

mericii‚ haerieii, and porkereeii.

capriolus (M. F. chevreuil), a roe.

This word has the same meaning as
⁴ cheuerellus‚’ which is merely a
Latinised form of the French ‘ chev-
reuiL’ A roe which was killed in the
year 1251 is described in the forest
inquisition (pp. 95, 96) 33 ‘ cheuerellus‚’
and in the corresponding eyre roll (p.
33) as ‘capriolus.' The word ⁴ chener-
illa' occurs in a record of 21 Ed. i.
(Placita De Quo Waranto, p. 601).

ceppus or cippus (p. 48), the stump of a

tree. This word, which is not un-
common, occurs in the Chapters of the
Regard, which are printed in Royal
Letters, Henry iii. (Rolls Series) vol. i.
p. 347: ‘quilibet ceppus de quercu et
de fago! The association of this word
to the word ‘ eradicare' on p. 48 leaves
no doubt about its meaning. Another
passage in which the same association
occurs is to be found in a Northampton
forest roll os the year 1338. Thus :
mandamus quod omnes cippos arbo-
rum predictarum in balliua uestra pro-
stratarum non eradicatos numeraretis
et euelleretis (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea,
No. 102).
‘ Ceppagium ’ seems to have been used
sometimes in the same sense as
‘ceppusss Thus t
