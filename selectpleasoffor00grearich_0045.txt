THE LESSER OOURTS OF THE FOREST XXXVll
appropriation continues with the words ‘and pleaded 1110111 111 1110
swanimotes.' Remembering that the forest 01 Rutland was on the
one side 011110 river Welland and the forest of Cliffe on the other,
we may conclude from the words we have quoted that the attachment
courts were called swanimotes in the former forest as well as in the
latter.l The word ‘attachment' apparently was not the recognised
designation 01 1110 court in all parts 01 1110 country. At an inquisition '2
held in the forest 01 Essex in the year 1239, a man was put by gage
and pledge to be at the next forest hundred because he was not
'present at the inquisition. Now the hundred was a civil court, which
was held every third week in each 01 1110 territorial divisions 01 0
county called hundreds, and had a small jurisdiction 111 civil matters.
It would seem, then, that the forest hundred was the term used to
describe the court 01 attachments in the county of Essex at this time,
as a court analogous in functions to the civil hundred.

The special Inquisition.³

Although the courts of attachinents were only concerned with the
small cases 01 trespasses to the vert and had no judicial power in
cases 01 trespasses to the venison, there was no other forest court
which sat at regular intervals‚ and none which had any final juris-

But it must not be supposed that the attachment courts and the court
01 1110 justices in eyre were the only tribunale which administered or
assisted in administering the forest laws. The forest inquisitions—of
which there were two sorte, the special and the general—formed the
basis 01 proceedings for trespasses to the venison.

By the articles known as the ‘ Consuetudines et Assise Foreste‚'
which are included among the ‘Statuta Incerti Temporis' of the
‘ Statutes 01 the Realm,’ ⁴ it was provided that if any beast of the forest

from the Gloucester eyre rolls 01 10 Ed. i.
that the attachment courts in the forest 01
Dean were sometimes calleci swanimotes :

³ It must be understood that the phrase
‘special inquisition ’ was not in use at the
time when the forest laws were enforced.
