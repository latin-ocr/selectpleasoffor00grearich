however, against the laws of the forest might be proved in the forest
inquisitione, which therefore supply a vast body of material for the
history of the forests in the fourteenth century. The following are a

few further extracts from inquisitione ¹ made in the forest of Rutland
towards the close of the reign of Edward ΠΙ.

IV.
THE FOREST EYRE.
‘I'he Forest Eyre of the year 1255.

THE forest eyre⁴ was a court called into being by the king's letters
patent appointing justices to hear and determine pleas of the forest
in a particular county or group of counties. Thus in the year 1255
William le Breton, Nicholas of Romsey, Geoffrey of Lewknor and
Simon of Thorp were appointed itinerant justices in the counties
of Huntingdon, Northampton‚ Buckingham and Oxford, by letters
patent5 which may be translated as follows z

The king to the archbishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons, knights,
freemen and all others of the counties of Huntingdon Northampton

¹ For. Proc., Tr. of Rea, No. 307.

² 2 September 1365.

⁸ 28 October 1370.

⁴ The proeeedings of the forest eyres
are enrolled on oblong-shaped pieces of
parchment sewn together at one end.
Each piece of parchment was called a
⁴ roll,' and the words ⁴ primus rotulus ’ are
often on the first roll, ‘secundus rotulus'
on the second, and so on. It is convenient

to speak of the whole series of rolls of an
eyre in any county as a ‘filex In some
letters patent of 2 November 1283, we
have ‘ uiginti et octo rotulos in uno liga-
mine de placitis foreste in comitatu
Suthampt' de itinere Rogeri de Clifford!
(See Patent Roll 101, m. 4.) In this
passage the word ‘ligamen' is properly
translated as ⁴ file.'
