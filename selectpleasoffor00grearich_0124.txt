cxvi INTRODUCTION

At the present day it is often found as a field name¹ in the west of
England‚ and it is not improbable that a similar usage prevailed 111
the Middle AgeS.

Authority may be cited to prove that the king's licence was
necessary before a subject could make a park; but whatever may
have been the case in Tudor and Stuart times, no such licence was
required in the reigns 01 the Plantagenet kingS, provided that their
rights of forest were not infringed. Sometimes, it is true, they
granted licences to make parks by letters patent or charter, but it
will be found that the royal grants were required because the parks
in question were situate either within a forest or in the immediate
neighbourhood 01 one.2 There are innumerable cases of trespasses in
pai-ks lying outside the king's forest mentioned on the Patent Rolls
of the reign 01 Edward 1. It would be impossible for licences to have
been granted by the king 101 the enclosure of all these parks without
the enrohnent 01 the licences appearing 011 the Patent Rolls, Charter
Rolls, 01 other recor-ds.3

¹ So too the word ‘ imparcare ‘ means to
impound or to put in an erc30sure. As a
general mle, however, ‘ a park' was used of
an enelosure expressly made sor deer. In
4 Ed. iii. a respondent answered to a writ
01 Quo Waranto at Derby as follows:

‘Et quod ad alium parcum quem clamat
dicit quod ille non est pareus, set est
quedam clausura que uocatur Estinker in
qua clausura continentur fere etc.‘ (Placita
(ίο Quo Isarmzsto, p. 151.)

Notwithstanding the answer 01 the re-
spondent to the writ concerning this park
he was amerced 101· his false claim :

‘Et quoad predictam clausturam que
uocatur Estinker quam clamat ut parcum
etc.⁷ idem ltobeitus in misericordia pro
falso claniio etc.'

A somewhat similar answer was given at
York early in the reign 01 Ε(1. i. ε

‘Et Robertns uenit et dicit quod non
clamat habere parcum ibidein; set dieit
quod antecessores sui etipse a ternpore 0011-
questus Anglie semper tenuerunt boscum
51111111 1110105010 111 500 5011010113
(lc Quo Πάνανιίο, p. 195.)

² Thus by letters patent dated 23
February 1335 the king granted Ralph (10
Neville licence to iinpark his woods 01
Middleham and Sheriff Hutton and to

(Planta

make a deer leap in the park 01 81101111
Hutton notwithstanding that it was near
the forest 01 Galtres. (Patent Roll 135, m.
34110 clainis to parks were 1111110 before the
king's justiees in Kent in ⁴5 Ed. ii. This

county contained no forests (p. cviii above),
but it must have contained many parks.
(Placila cle Quo Waranto, pp. 310 to 368.)
There was also no forest in Norsolk, and no
elaims to parks in that county were made be-
fore theking's justices in 14 Ed. 1. (ibid. pp.
4s1r41as.) It should also benoticed that in the
charter 01 is May 1204, which disafforested
all the eounty 01 1)01·011 except Dartnioor
and Exmoor, the king declared that the
111011 01 Devon might make parks outside
the metes 01 the excepted forests. The
language 01 the chartei· suggests that the
king was only granting them a privilege
which was enjoyed everywhere outside
the royal for-ests <Romu Chartarum,
132.)

³ On the other hand, there certainly are
cases in which the owners 01 parks were
called upon to show by what warrant thoy
held them, even when the parks were not
Situate in or 11( ar sorests. This happened
in 4 Ed. iii. with respect to Wrast (now
YVrest) park in Bedffirdshire, which is at a
considerable distance 110111 a forest. (Placita
cle Quo 11111011ίο, p. 45.) It may be thatin
these cases the king's advisers set up a
claim which could not be justified by
precedent. Sometimes, however, a park
seems to have been considered as an
encroaehnient upon rights of common.
Thus:

‘Hugo de Swyllington summonitus fuit
ad respondendnm domino regi (10 placito
qno waranto appropriauit sibi parcum in
