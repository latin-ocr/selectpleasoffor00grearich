XC INTRODL‘CTION

was no need for its enrolment. The case of Bobert the parson of
Polebrook and William the parson of Barnack, part of which is
printed above, supplies an instance of clerks making fine without it ,
being stated on the rolls that they were delivered to the bishop. The
enrolment of this case proceeds z

Postea uenit Gilebertus de Bernak’ et finem fecit per quadraginta solidos
per pleuinam Mauricii de Andeli et Thome de YVelham capellani. Postea
Willelmus persona de Bernak’ taxatur ad uiginti solidos. Et Robertus
persona de Pokebroc taxatur ad decem marcas. Et Iohannes Faunel pauper
et perdonatur.

In this case it will be observed that the clerks are described as
being taxed‚ and not as making fine. The use of the expression can-
not be easily explained. It seems to have been used generally when
the clergy had been convicted of a trespass against the venison. But
in some cases clerks made fine and in others laymen were taxed.

The forest procedure was evidently considered as very unsatis-
factory by the clergy, for in the year 1257, they, having granted to
the king a sum of fifty thousand marks, drew up a long list¹ of
grievances which contained the two following articles 2 z

Item, cum contingit clericum pro delicto foreste defamari, per inquisicionem
uiridariorum et forestariorum super capcione uenacionis uocatur coram
iusticiariis3 et licet ab ordinariis repetatur, nisi prius carceri laicali manci-
petur, suo ordinario nullatenus liberatur ; et post liberacionem factam
episcopo, per inquisicionem factam per laicos pena pecuniara condempnatur.

Item similiter condempnantur absentes et ignorantes ad simplicem uocem
uiridariorum et forestariorum cum ad inquisicionem per laicos factam non
debeant condempnari clerici uel aliqualiter iudicari, et tam isti quam illi
compelluntur soluere merciamenta per possessiones laicales si quas habent.
Sin autem, distringuntur episcopi per baronias suas, ut dictos clericos com-
pellant de suis beneficiis soluere condempnacionem.

The meaning of the clause ‘ nisi prius carceri laicali mancipetur ’
in the first of these articles is not quite clear, but it seems that the
justices refused to deliver an accused clerk to the ordinary unless he
had previously been imprisoned by way of process to secure his
appearance at the forest eyre. If he had been so impflsoned, the
