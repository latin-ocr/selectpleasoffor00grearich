NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, An. 1246 81

Pledges of the town of Great Oakley being before the justices :—
Roger the son of Robert, Geoffrey the son of Nicholas.

The arrows with which Mathew was wounded were delivered to
Sir Robert Basset and John Lovet, verderers.

The greyhounds were sent to Sir Robert Passelewe, then justice of
the forest.

An inquisition was made at Benefield in the thirtieth year of the
reign of King Henry before Sir Alan of Maidwell‚ sheriff of North-
ampton, concerning Mathew the forester, who was killed at Beanfield,
by all the townships of the hundreds of Corhy, Stoke‚ Rothwell and
Stodfold‚ and by thirty-four as well knights as free and loyal men of
the country, whose names are underwritten‚ to wit, . . . ‚ and by the
foresters and verderers of that bailiwick, who all say upon oath that
they know nothing thereos except only that when J ames of Thurlbear,
the brother of Mathew who was killed, Thomas Borhard, John the son
of Ives, foresters of the lord king, were eating on the Friday2 next ⁴
after the close of Easter in the same year with the abbot of Pipewell,
the aforesaid foresters saw in the abbey of Pipewell three greyhounds,
to wit, one tawny, one fallow, and one black covered. And two of these
greyhounds were taken when Mathew the forester was elain, and the
third, the tawny greyhound, escaped with the malefactors. And Simon
of Kivelsworthy avowed the same greyhounds in the abbey of Pipewell
before the abbot of Pipewell. And because the foresters‚ on being
sworn, presented to the verderers that the greyhounds which were
taken when Mathew was killed were the same as those which the said
Simon avowed, the said Simon of Kivelsworthy was, on suspicion of
the death aforesaid, taken and sent to Northampton to be imprisoned.
And Alan of Maidwell was then sheriff.

And the abbot of Pipewel] finds pledges of answering before the
justices of the forest for harbouring the said Simon and the said grey-
hounds; and he avowed the said Simon and the greyhounds. And
these are the names of his pledges . . .

It happened on the day⁷ of St. Barnabas the Apostle, in the
thirtieth year of the reign of King Henry, that James of Thur-Ibem,
forester in the park of Brigstock‚ came into the park of Brigstock
