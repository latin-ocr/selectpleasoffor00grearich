made by four neighbouring townships Geddingt0n‚ Stanion, Brigstock
and Boughton who could ascertain nothing 11101001 ; and because they

It is presented by the same persons that William of Foresthill,
the 10100101· 111 1110 bailwick of Farm, being suspected 01 evil deeds to
the Venison, was attached; and now he came. And Robert Basset,
Richard of Aldwinkle and John Lovet, the verderers, say that he is
not guilty nor is he suspected 01 any evil deed 3 therefore 110 10 quit.
And because they presented in their rolls on the first day that William
was suspected and now they entirely 30111111 him, therefore they must
answer to the lord king for the ransom of the said William. Item,
the verderers are quit, because the amercement is elsewhere.

It is presented and proved by the same persons that on Wednes-
