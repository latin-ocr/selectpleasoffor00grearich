punishment. On the other hand, we frequently find that trespassers
were pardoned ¹ because they were poor ; and the justices seem to
have taken into consideration 2 the time which a prisoner had spent
in gaol before he had been released by writ to pledges until the eyre.

We can form a good idea of the system of ransom from the follow-
ing list of sums paid as fines for trespasses in Guildford Park at the
cyre 3 111 Surrey in the year 1272 :-—

Miscellaneous Matters 011 1110 Eyre Rolls.

Besides the pleas 01 1110 1701110011 and the vert, other matters were
recorded on the eyre rolls, 01 11111011 some, however, are not found on
the rolls of every eyre. There was always a regard enrolled on them,
the nature of which will be explained in another section of this Intro·
duction. Again the names of those who were essoined of death were
invariably enrolled. Where a trespasser ⁵ died before the coming of
the justices in 05710, his pledges would be amerced just as if he had
been alive and had failed to appear, unless his death were proved by an
essoiner. The enrolment of the 00001110 does 1101 (11001000 1110 1101010

¹ Cases in which the justices are ex-
pressly stated to have taken the poverty of
the prisoner into consideration in settling
his ransom occur on pp. 58 bis and 60
below. Many similar cases could be cited
from other forest eyre rolls.

considered 1110 time a prisoner had already
spent in prison, in settling his ransom,

2⁴.) 0111130 below. At the Gloucestershire
forest eyre of 1277 0 trespasser was allowed
to find two pledges only instead of six or
twelve‚ because he had already lain in
prison two and 0 11011 years:

‘Manucaptores Willelnii Mile in forma
predicta duo tantum, quia iacuit in prisona

per duos annos et dimidium et quia pauper.’
(For. Proca, Tr. of Rea, No. 30, Rozz 25.)

Τ110 mainperners here mentioned were
pledges that prisoner would commit no
further trespasses against the venison.

³ See pp. 54 to 61 below.

⁴ It 10 not obvious 111157 John of Aldham
had to pay so heavy a ransom.

⁵ For examples of persons being essoined
of death see pp. 12, 20, 35, 41, and 56
below. The entries on the list of essoins
corresponding· to the two 00001110 mentioned
on p. 56 below 010 00 follows : ‘ VVilhelmus
