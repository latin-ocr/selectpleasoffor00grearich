C INTRODUCTION

during the reign 01 Stephen, and had been reafforested by Henry ΙΙ.
after his coronation. Accordingly he directed that the forests in
these three counties, should be kept as they were before the perambu-
lations had been made. About the same time the knights who had
made the perambulation in Nottinghamshire acknowledged that they
had wrongly disafforested two places and obtained leave to certify
themselves of their true boundaries. The king then directed that no
person having woods in those places should fell, sell 01 666611 them,
until it had been determined what were the boundaries.1

On 13 August the king sent ² letters close to seventeen of his sheriffs
consisting 01 611 order relating to Magna Carta and directions relating
to the forest, similar in form to those which he had sent on 10 January
to the 61161111 01 Shropshire. On the same day he sent the order
relating to Magna Carta to the sheriff 01 Northumberland, and also to
the sheriffs of N ottingham and Dei-by, Warwick and Leicester‚ Rutland,
Cambridge and Huntingdon, Berkshire, Bedford and Buckingham.
After the enrolment of the names 01 these counties on the Close Roll,
it is stated that although they are in the forest3 they had not the long
form (meaning the letters close sent to the first seventeen sheriffs),
because they were quit, but they had the short form (meaning the
order relating to Magna Carta), together with the underwritten sheriffs,
11611161)γ 111066 01 81166664 Κ6111, Middlesex, Norfolk and Suffolk.

Thus the short form was sent to the sheriffs 01 the counties in
which there were no 1016616, and also to the sheriffs of the counties
which contained 1016616 about the boundaries 01 which the king was
already satisfied. He had pardoned ⁵ the knights who had made the
perambulations in Rutland, Leicester‚ Huntingdon and Nottingham
by letters patent dated 9 February then last past. He had dis-
afforested6 by a charter dated 10 May a portion 01 the county 01
Berkshire, and the boundaries 01 the forest in that county were no
longer in question. It 16 not recorded that he had pardoned the
knights who had made the perambulations in the counties 01 Derby‚⁷

¹ On 20 April 1228 1116 knights who
had made perambulations in the following
0011111166 were pardoned by the king 101·
their errors: namely, Laneaster, Stafford,
Salop, worcester, Surrey and Nol-thamp-
ton. (Patent Roll 36, 111. 5.) The knights
who made the perambulation in Yorkshire
were pardoned on 31 001011611228. (Patent
Roll 37, 111. 12.)

³ It should not be inferred from this
that there were for-ests in Cambridgeshire
and Btdfordshirc. The former county had

a sheriff in common with Huntingdonshire‚
and Bedfordshire had one in common with
Buckinghamshire.

⁴ Northumberland is mentioned on the
roll together with these five counties, but
evidently by mistake. The order relating
to Magna Carta was sent to its sheriff, as
stated in the roll, who was quit. The forest
in Northumberland was disafi'orested in
the reign 01 Ed. i. See p. cviii below.
