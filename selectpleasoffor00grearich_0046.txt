were found dead or wounded an inquisition was to be held by four
neighbouring townships of the forest3 the finder of the deer was to
be put by six pledges‚ the flesh was to be sent to a neighbouring
spittal house or given to the sick and poor3 the head and the skin
were to be given 10 1116 1166111611 01 1116 neighbouring township‚ and
the arrow was 10 116 presented to a verderer. The word which repre-
sents beast of the forest in the original is ‘fera‚' which is usually
translated by the word ‘ deer.’ As, however, inquisitionsl were held
on dead or wounded wild boars and on hares in those districts where
they were preserved by 1116 101651 laws, we may reasonably render
‘ fera ’ 115 116651 01 1116 101651 111 this passage.

It is very doubtful when these articles were first issued, but our
earliest record² of an inquisition which seems to have been made
pur-suant to them is 01 1116 year 1238.³ In another inquisition made
two years later we read of a buck which was found one Sunday lying
dead in a field in the forest of Essex. On the same day an inquisi-
tion was held by four neighbouring townships, who said that it died of
murrain and was almost dragged to pieces by the pigs. Each of the
townships found pledges of being before the justices in eyre at their
next pleas, 65 6150 (11(1 1116 four neighbours, the finder of the buck and
the lady in whose field it was found. The head with its 61111615 was
entrusted 10 6 man-presumably a freeman of 0116 01 1116 neighbouring
townships—to produce before the justices, while the mutilated fiesh
and the skin were, no doubt, 1611 101 1116 pigs to devour. Here we
have some observances which were not directed by the ‘ Consuetudines
et Assise ⁹——namely‚ the finding pledges by the four townships‚ the
four neighbours and the owner of the field respectively. Probably
the procedure was adopted which obtained in inquisitions before the
coroners ⁴ on the bodies 01 dead men, it being usual for the four neigh-
bours, and all suspected personS‚ as well as the four townships which

(Forest Lawes, ed. 1615, p. 8) they were
issued in 6 Edward i.‚ but he gives no autho-
rity for his statement. No official version of
them is 10 116 found on the rolls at the Public
Record Office, but there are many copies 01
1116111 in private collections 01 statutes at
the British Museum and elsewhere. It is
possible that the articles are not all 01 1116
561116 date. The directions as to attach-
ments for trespasses to the vert 616 01 6 de-
tailed character, and they do not appear to
have been strictly observed in the latter
part of the reign 01 Η61115 iii. On the other
hand, the inquisitions of 22 to 26 Henry iii.
printed on pp. 69 to 74 below, show a stricter

compliance with the articles relating to the
venison than those 01 32 10 39 Henry iii.
printed on pp. 74 to 116 below. It is pro-
bable that the first eleven articles were
issued in the early years of the reign of
Henry iii. or even in the reign of John.
The cyre rolls certainly show no change in
the forest law or its administration after
6 Edward i. which in any way corroborates
Manwood‘s statement that they were issued
in that year.
