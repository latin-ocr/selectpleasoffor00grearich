The Relation of the Eyre Rolls to the Rolls of Special Inquisitions.

Let us now consider in detail the relation of the rolls of the eyre
to the rolls of special inquisitions. There has survived to the present
day a portion of a roll of special inquisitions relating to the venison
in the forest of Huntingdon during part of the reign of Henry III.
It has no title, but the first entry¹ which is enrolled upon it is an
inquisition dated the 4th March 124} and the last 2 a memorandum
dated the 28th April 1253. Its ten entries, of which seven are the
records of special inquisitions and three 3 the memoranda of trespasses
in the forest, follow one another in chronological order. The rolls of the
Huntingdon eyre 4 of June 1255, have also survived to the present day.

These eyre rolls cover a rather wider period than the roll of special
inquisitions. The earliest5 entry among the pleas of the venison
relates to a trespass committed in J anuary 124} 3 the latest to another ⁵
committed in April 1255. It is probable, therefore, that two mem-
branes‚ one at the top, the other at the bottom, of our roll of special
inquisitions, or perhaps two distinct rolls, have been lost.

For the purpose of considering the relation which subsists between
the two classes of records, the rolls of the Huntingdon eyre are not
satisfactory. Unlike other records of proceedings in eyre the entries
on these rolls are not in chronological order. They assist in establish-
ing the proposition that to every entry on the roll of special inquisi-
tions there is, in general, a corresponding entry on the eyre rolls.
But they do not assist us to determine whether there can be an entry
among the pleas of the venison on the eyre rolls without a corre·
sponding entry on the roll of special inquisitions.

We learn more from two rolls of inquisitions held in the years
30 to 39 Henry ΠΙ. in the forest of Rockingham. Of these one⁷
consists of inquisitions and memoranda relating to events which
happened during the years 30 to 34 Henry 111.; the other ⁸ of similar
entries relating to events which happened in the five following years.
The contents of the earlier roll may be described as follows. There
are four inquisitions and two memoranda of 30 Henry ΙΠ.; two
inquisitions and one memorandum of 31 Henry ΠΙ. ; four inquisitions
of 32 Henry III. ς three inquisitions and one memorandum of
