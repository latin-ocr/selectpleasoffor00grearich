uel consuetudine.

In the record of an attachment court
held in the forest of Galtres on the
27th August 1289, we have:

Uillate de Silling' in misericordia eo

quod porci sui capti fuerunt in dominico
domini regis cum uardo facto (For.

Proc„ Tr. of Rea, 237).
The words ‘ cum warda facta ' appear to
mean ⁴ with watch set‚‘ and to refer to
cattle which were deliberately placed
in the forest and restricted from roam-
ing at large. If the owners of cattle
pasturing in the forest had been per-
mitted to watch them, they would have
appropriated for them the best pastures
of the forest to the exclusion of the
king's deer. As to this see Acts of the
Parliament of Scotland, vol. i. p. 323.
The passages quoted above should
be compared with the following extract
fron] Les bons usaqes . . . . (Z’Oleron
which is printed with a translation in
the Black Book of the Admiraltgs
(Rolls Series, vol. ii. p. 300) ε
Et non pero prez puys que il sunt
fauche ne sunt il mie pasturau com-
munau a pors m a beste foyllant ne
encore a nule autre beste par tau

estachier la beste, quar si ele est trobee
ou prise estachee au pau, ele deit rendre

The custom which was called ‘ warde-
fet ² was probably money paid for per-
mission to have beasts pasturing in the
forests with watch set. The custom is
occasionally mentioned in the Patent

and Close Rolls of the reign of Ed. iii.
with respect to the forests in the
counties of Nottingham and Derby;
thus :

ipsum R. pro aueriis suis infra dictam
pasturam suam inuentis ad denarios
pro quadani consuetudine infra forestam
predictam que uocatur wardefet ad opus
nostrum prestandos per uarias distric-
ciones compellitis (Close Roll 100, m.
24 (Ζ).

The sanie sequence of words occurs in
some letters patent of 3 November 1339
(Ραί. Βοίἰ 198, m. 15 cl).

At a later date, however, the custom of
‘ wardefet ’ appears to have denoted the
driving of the forest from time to time
for the purpose of impounding cattle
which ought not to be pasturing there.
The following is the explanation of
the word ‘wardefet ' as used in the
forest of Galtres in the time of
Hen. viii. :

Wardefett'. Item the seides tenauntes
haythe been accustoniede to dryve and
pynde all the bounderz goodes i'ownding

teaning to his maiestes crowne euery
