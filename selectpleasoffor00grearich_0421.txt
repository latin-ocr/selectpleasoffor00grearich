such as ‘ rubeus,' ¹ niger,’ or ¹ faluus’ ;
thus:

cum duobus lepomriis, quorum unus

erat fauw et pilosus et alius erat rubeus
couere (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, No. 132,
Roll 6).

cum duobus leporariis quorum unus
fuit niger couueire et alter faus uestitus
(supra, p. 96).

duos canes unum faus couerre et

alium griseum, qui uocatur Gower (For.
Proc„ Tr. of Rea, No. 5, Roll 9 d).

The expression ‘ niger coueratus ’
(p. 81) should be noticed in considering
the meaning of this word. See also
tigrus and uerrus below.

dama (MF. daime), the doe, the female
of the fallow deer.
damus, (ME. daim) the buck, the male
of the fallow deer.
damericii. This is an adjective used
with the word ‘canes ' to signify buck-
hounds. An example of its use in the
reign of Hen. iii. has already been
quoted from some letters close of
18 August 1227, under the word
cernericii. We also have in some letters
close of 30 June 1213 ι
mittimus ad uos W. de M. 011111 tribus
hominibus et duobus equis et duodecim

deimericiis et sex leporariis (Rot. Lite.
Claus. i. 137).

Again, in some letters close of 16
August 1215 we have :
mittimus ad uos A. de C. cum duobus
equis suis et quatuordecim canibus nos-
tris daimmariciis mandantes quatinus
ipsum cum canibus suis currere faciatis
in B. ad danmos (ibid. i. 225).
And in other letters close of 29 October
1225 we have :

cum canibus deimericiis ad curren-
dum ad damos (Rot. Lite. Glaus. ii. 84).

On the Berkshire eyre rolls of 12

Ed. i. the following entry occurs :
Willelmus Louel tenet duas carucatas
terre de domino rege apud Benham per

serianciam custodiendi unam meutam

deymiterorum canum (Assize Rolls, No.
46, Rozz 5 d).

As a rule the words ‘canes damericii ’
were used only of a particular breed of
running hounds used for buck hunting.
From an early date, however, the

manor of Little &Veldon in North-
amptonshire was held by the service 01
keeping the king's ‘ canes dainericii‚'
and it is probable that in this case,
which is an exceptional one, they were
a pack consisting partly of running
hounds and partly of greyhounds. Un-
doubtedly in the reign of Hen. vi. the
word buckhounds included both grey-
hounds and running hounds, for in
27 Hen. vi. the lord of the manor of
Little VVeldon presented a petition in
parliamcnt in which the following
passage occurs:

Forasmuche that he holdith of
you . . . the mancii· of Lityll XVeldon in
the counte of Norhamt' by Graunte
Sergeaunte, that 15 to witte, to be
maister of your Bul-thoundes and to
kepe xxiiij rennyng houndes and vj

grehoundebs (Roas of Parliameut, vol.
v. p. 167, ).

deductus (F. defluit), game. By the letters

patent dated 27 January 141} appoint-
ing a justice of the forest south of
Trent (Pat. Rolz 399, m. 12) 118 was
also appointed ‘magister deductus.'
With three exceptions all subsequent
holders of the office were appointed
‘ magistri deductus ' which was trans-
lated, as soon as the letters patent
began to be written in English, as
‘master of the game.’ An early
instance of the word occurs in the
Patent Roll of 19 Ed. i. (Ραέ. ΒΟΖΖ
109, m. 23) but in the corresponding
Calendar of Patent Rolls (p. 413) it is
wrongly translated as ‘decoy.' An
earlier form is ‘ deduccio‚' which occurs
in the Close Roll of 36 Η811. iii. thus :

facere septem trencheyas . . . ad de-
ducciones regis (Close Rom 66, m. 24).

escapium (p. 64), money paid for beasts

escaping into forbidden enclosures.
The payments varied in different places.
A full account of the paynients enforced
in a bailiwick in the forest of Peek is
found on the Derby forest eyre rolls ot'
13 Ed. i. :

Tota Campania infra metas suas est
in defenso per totum annum 3 et similiter
Eydal'3 ita quod nemo habet communam
nec accessum in eadem curn aueriis. Et

si aueria uel animalia ibidem uenerint
per eschapium, dabitur pro eisdem,
