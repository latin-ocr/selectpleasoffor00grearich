of the inquisition. There is nothing to suggest that the attachment
was made on any other occasion, or at the court of attachments
in particular. The Charter of the Forest certainly directed the
verderers and foresters to assemble every forty days to view the
attachments not only with respect to the vert, but also with respect
to the venison. But the spirit of the provision was in no way violated
by the attachments of trespassers to the venison being made in the
forest inquisitions. The purpose of the chartei· was, no doubt, to
secure publicity‚ but this was quite sufficiently assured by an attach-
ment at an inquisition, which was made before the foresters and
verderers by four neighbouring townships.

The forest inquisition was necessary only when a beast of the forest
was found dead or wounded‚ or when a trespass had been committed
in the forest. If a man was caught in the act of taking venison he
was forthwith imprisoned and could only be set at liberty by a writ
from the king or the justice of the forest. According to the Charter
of the Forest, if a man was arrested and convicted of taking
venison he was to be heavily ransomed, if he had wherewith he could
be ransomed, and if he had not wherewith he could be ransomed he
was to lie in prison for a year and a day, and if after a year and a
day he could find pledges he was to come out of prison, and if he
could not find them he was to abjure the realm.1 Thus the longest
term of imprisonment was to be a year and a day. But in the middle
of the reign of Henry HL, and perhaps at the beginning of his
reign, when a man who had taken venison was arrested and sent
to prison, he was imprisoned in the first instance by way of process
and not by way of punishment. He was usually released by writ'2
to twelve persons, who undertook to produce him at the next eyre and
that he would commit no trespass in the meantime. His punishment
was always reserved for the justices in eyre, and to this rule there
were no exceptions. It is difficult to say how long men might lie in
prison before they were released on pledge. Certainly they sometimes
lay there more than a year and a day, but these were exceptional
