BUCKmGHAmstE, NORTHAMPToxsnIRss, AD. 1278 124

And the same Hugh had the after-pannage after the feast of
St. Martin, and he made piggeries in the forest at his will.

And he took during all his time from the towns of East Pury
and Yardley from every virgate of land a goose and a hen and four
pence in every year and a quarter of oats3 and from Weststratford and
from Turweston twelve pence for paling and for having dead wood in
the demesne, as has been before said.

And he was wont to collect eggs through all his bailiwick of
Wakefield 3 and he was wont to have chiminage through all his
bailiwick.

And he was wont to have all the dead wood in his bailiwick afore-
said, and to have his beasts of the plough pasturing over all the
bailiwick aforesaid.

Wibert of Towcester rendered to the aforesaid John de Neville for
his bailiwick of Hazelborough ten shillings a year at the aforesaid
terms ; and he had in his bailiwick all the old fuel trees for his own
use. And if the lord king gave any oak in his bailiwick, the same
Wibert had the crop thereos.

And he had from every house in the town of Syresham one hen at
Christmas and ten eggs at Easter, and in Stratford a quarter of oats,
and in Turweston twelve pence3 and he had after-pannage in his
bailiwick3 and he made piggeries in his bailiwick at his will; and he
took nuts in the demesne of the lord king in his bailiwick; and
chiminage in his bailiwick in aid of his farm.

They say also that Elias of Tingewick, from the time when the lord
king Henry gave to him the aforesaid bailiwicks, took chiminage
through the whole of his bailiwick, and dead wood in the woods of
the king for his own use; and nuts in the same woods, when there
were any, except in the park of Handley3 and after-pannage after the
feast of St. Martin, except in the park of Handley5 and the custody of
pigs; and the crops of oaks which are given by the king in the forest,
except in the said park3 and a place which is called La Siche for
herbage between Shrob and Puxley. And he had and ought to have
the custody of the wood of Silverstone.

And, as they understand, those things which the aforesaid Elias
took belong to the custody of his bailiwick of the forest aforesaid
to make up the farm aforesaid because the same Elias renders a
farm, as the aforesaid persons did, to wit two and a half marks for
the bailiwick of Wakefield and ten shillings for the bailiwick of
Hazelborough.
