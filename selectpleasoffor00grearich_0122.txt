in three shillings and a penny. Again in 801116 0116868 1116 lords held
eourts which were called swanimotes. There is a 0686 in the Year
Book 0121 611(1 22 Ed. Ι. conoerning a right 01 pasture in a wood
within the free 011686 01 Whaddon in the county of Buckingham.
Counsel, addressing the 001111 011 behalf of the lord of the chase‚ stated
that it had been given to an ancestor of the lord by Henry ΠΙ. 10 hold
as a 011686 in the same manner as it had been held by the king when
it was forest, and that the lord had three swanimotes yearly 101
searehing and inquiring whether anyone put more beasts therein than
he ought to put. The actual words ¹ 01 1116 1611011 616 68 follows:

The lord 016 private forest or 011686 8661118 6180 10 have been at
liberty to appoint verderers to protect his rights. By a charter² of
the early years of Hemy ΠΙ. John de Vezpont granted 10 1116 lords 01
1116 111611018 01 Waroop, Sandford, Burton and Hitton, all in the county
01 Westinoreland‚ freedorn 110111 10168161’8 111111116, 611(1 110111 611 things

of the verderers 01 1111111618. It is 01661 110111 this chartei· that the
verderers mentioned in it were the officials 01 1116 lord 016 private
forest. Again, the memorandum ³ to which we have already referred
shows that there were Officers called verderers in the free 011686 01
Malvern, although their duties undoubtedly differed from those of
verderers in the king’s forests. It is possible, however, that at an
earlier date verderers in this 011686 were engaged in work similar to
that 01 verderers in a forest.

Manwood in his ‘Forest Laws’ described ⁴ the buck, the doe, 1116 fox,
the marten and the roe as beasts of the 011686. But his description
is not well founded in law. When the king granted a forest to a
subject his rights over the venison or beasts of the forest passed to his
grantee. No legal significance was attached to the words ‘ beasts 01 1116
011686.’ When they were used they were intended to denote the venison
of a 011686 611(1 1101 6 01688 01 beasts distinet 110111 1116 1166818 01 1116 forest.
