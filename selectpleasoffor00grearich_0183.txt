Ramsey and six dogs of the same abbot, which were running in the
forest, were taken by Robert of Twywell the forester in Huinberdale‚
within the metes of the forest. And he delivered them to Hugh of
Goldingham‚ the steward 01 1116 forest, who now has the said hunter
and dogs before the justices. And upon this 6011166 1116 bishop-
elect 01 Ely by his attorney, and says that the said hunter and dogs
were taken in the free chace of Humberdale of him the said bishop-
elect. And he seeks that inquiry may be made by the verdere1·s and
foresters‚ who say that the said hunter and dogs were taken in the
forest and outside the banlieu; but they say that the said hunter
did not come there for the purpose of evil doing in the forest ; but 116
661116 110111 1116 liberty of his lord within his banlieu ; and some of his
dogs were running towards the marsh and some towards the forest3
and he went after those dogs 10 6611 them back, and for no 011161·
reason; and this he did against 1116 117111 611(1 without 1116 knowledge
