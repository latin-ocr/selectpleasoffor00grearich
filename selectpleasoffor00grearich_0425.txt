una seriancia assignata ad capiendos
lupos in foresta . . .

Et quesitum est que iura pertinent ad
serianoiam 1110111. Dicunt quod 1111110 ni-
si terra tantum, et 11011 debet nominari
inter balliuas de Campan', set quod
quolibet anno, uidelicet, tempore Marcii
et tempore Septembris, debent ire per
mediam forestam ad ponendas pegas ad
lupos capiendos ubi fuerit accessus
luporum eo quod illis temporibus non
possunt lupi odorare terram fossam adeo
bene sicut aliis temporibus anni. Et
eciam ibunt in foresta tempore estatis
circiter festum sancti Barnabe quando
lupi habent catulos ad illos capiendos
et distruendos et non aliis temporibus.
Et tunc habebunt cum eis unum gar-
cionem portantem ingenia sua. Et
omnes erunt iurati et portabunt unam
hachiam et unam gesarme et cultellum
ad zonam suam et 11011 arcus nec sagittas.
Et habebunt secum unum mastinum

non expeditatum et ad hoc edoctum.

Et erunt ad sumptus suos proprios; et
nichil aliud facient in foresta (Duchy
of Lancaster, For. Proc„ Bzmdle 1,
No. 5, Rozl 14 d).

1111011011, otterhounds. In a Wardrobe

Account of 18 Ed. i. the following entry
appears :

Et Iohanni 10 Oterhunte pro putura

octo canum suorum lutericiorum
(Accozmts, QR„ Bzmdle 352, No. 26,
m. 4, 4th (md 5th entries).

Ed. iv. had a pack of otterhounds
which, like the packs of harriers and
buckhounds, was composed partly of
running hounds and partly of grey-
hounds. By letters patent dated
18 July 1461 the ‘office called 0101-
hunt' was granted to Thomas Harde-
groue for life. The letters patent
contain the following recitaI:

Cum Thomas Hardegroue officium
uocatum otei-hunt a quinto die Marcii
ultimo preterito hucusque occupauerit
et duos leporarios et decem canes
currentes in custodia sua per idem
tempus habuerit (Patent Rolz 495,
m. 5).

maninus, 0 mastiff. It is difficult to

distinguish between the letters u and n
in thirteenth century handwrffings, but
the word seems to be ‘mastinuS‚' not
‘ mastiuus.’ It should be remembered
that the corresponding Modern French

word is ‘matinff On the other hand,
in an inquisition held at New Salisbury
in 44 Ed. iii. we have the words, ‘ cum
uno cane uocato mastif ’ (For. Proc„
Tr. of Rea, 318, Fourteenth Skm).
The spelling with the letter 11 15 001-
roborated by Mathew Paris, who states
that a legate α latere, Magister Martinus,
was nicknamed ‘ mastinus’ on account
of his rapacity :
quem propter improbam rapacitatem
suam multi magistrum Mastinum appel-

larunt (Chronica Maiora, Rolls 801105,
iv. 368).

The word mastiff in the middle ages may
have sometimes been used of the bull-
dog, which belongs to the mastiff class;
but in the thirteenth century it is prob-
01110 11101 11 usually denoted 0 dog re-
sembling a modern mastiff. There is
abundant evidence that the ‘mastiff ’
was used to protect its master's
property. Thus in the Buckingham
forest eyre 10115 of 1256 we have :
duo mastini . . . quos H. R. messor
dicti abbatis solitus fnit ducere secum
ad campum dicti abbatis custodiendum
inuenti fuerunt dilacerantes unum
soerum (101111 (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea,
No. 2, Roll 1 d).

Numerous entries on the eyre rolls show
that it was large and strong enough to
kill deer, although it was certainly not
used as a hunting dog. It was because
it was capable of doing injury to the
beasts of the forest, and was at the same
time a possession almost necessary to
the inhabitants of the forest, that they
were allowed to possess them, provided
that they were lawed: that is to say,
provided that three claws were cut from
the forefoot ‘without the ball.’

The mastiff was also used for de-
stroying wolves; see lupus above.

mota (p. 99, M. F. meute), a pack of

hounds. Some examples of the use of
this word will be found above under
canes de mota.

ouiare (pp. 19 and 36), a. mediaeval form

of ⁴ obuiare.’

palna or pauna. This word frequently

occurs in the Close Rolls in conjunc·
tion with ‘cheuerones' and 60091110,ἦ
