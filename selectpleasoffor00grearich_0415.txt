GLOSSARY 1 35

Umfridus de Monte [tenet] manerium
de Whitefeld cum pertinenciis per seri-
anciam affectandi unum bracketum ad
opus domini regis cum ipse dominus rex
preceperit ad currendum ad ceruum eb
hissam et damum et damam (p. 28, a).

The corresponding entry in the Hun-
dred Rolls is as follows :

Et sciendum quod dominus Hemicus

rex proauus regis nunc dictum manerium

dedit cuidam Philippo de Monte per

seruicium afeytandi quemdam 110150101-
111111 (Rot. Hand. ii. p. 6).

Again‚ on the Olose Roll of 3 Ed. ii.
we have:

R. de B. defunctus et Ι. uxor eius
tenuerunt . . . quasdam terras et que-
dam tenementa in Stanhowe et Causton
. . .; que quidem terre et tenementa
tenentur de nobis in capite per seruicium
custodiendi unum bercellum nostrum
cum nos bercellum illum ibidem ad

custodiendum mittere uoluerimus (Close
Roll 132, m. 26).

But the same serjeanty is thus de-
scribed in Testa cle Nervill, p. 299, b :
De serianciis dicunt quod Willelmus

le May tenet quandam in Stanho per
seruicium custodiendi unum bracketum.

It is probable that the 1150 of the
word ‘bersellus' instead of ‘bersel-
letus ’ on the Close Roll of 3 Ed. ii. is
intentional, for on the Norfolk eyre
rolls of 12 Ed. 1. there is an entry con-
cerning this serjeanty in which the
word ‘ brachettus ' 15 qualified τ

Dicunt quod Iohanna que fuit uxor

Iohannis Kyng tenet quandam serian-

ciam in Stanhow . . . per serianciam

custodiendi unum brachettum (1051111010-

tum domini regis in capite de domino
rege (Assize Rozls 573, Rot. 74 d).

Another case in which a bercelet is
described as a brach is printed below
under the word braehettus. The Close
Rolls of the reign of Ed. ii. supply
many examples of hunters being sent
with a considerable number of running
hounds (see canes currentes) and grey=
hounds to take venison; they were
usually accompanied by a bercelleter
who was in charge of one 01· more
bercelets.

The following passage from the
second part of the Patent Roll of 1
Ric. ii. is of some interest ε

Constituimus . . . 1. L. magistrum
canum nostrorum uocatorum berceletz
. . . dantes ei licenciam expediendi
eosdem canes necnon habendi et faci-
endi cum eis sectas ad quascunque
bestias feras infra forestas chaceas et
parcos nostros prout sibi pro expedi-
cione et informacione dictorum canum

pro deducto nostro fore uidebitur facien-
dum (Pat. Rozz 299, m. 21).

The bercelet was probably a specially
trained brach, which was used for find-
ing the decr to be hunted. There can
be little doubt that the words ‘berser-
ettus‚’ ‘berselletus‚' and ‘berserez'
represented the same kind of hound.
On the ‘Botulus Misae ' of 14 John
⁴ brachetti berserez ’ are mentioned (500
brachettus, below). In some letters close
dated 1 September 1213, we have ε

R. de S„ D. de N. peremdinantes

apud C. . . . cum decem equis et xxij

canibus berserettis et xviij garcionibus
(Rot. Litt. Olane. i. p. 151).

In some other letters of October 1214,
the following words occur ι

Et Hugo de Albin‘ [dat domino regi
unum brachettum bon' berseret] (ibid.
i. p. 173).

See also bernarius.

berserecii. These hounds are frequently

mentioned on the ⁶ Rotulus Misae’ of
14 John. They are usually mentioned
as having been under the charge of
‘ garciones ' or grooms (Cole’s Docu-
ments illustrarim of Enqlislt Historgs,
pp. 231, 232, 248, 253, etc.). In this
roll no hounds called ⁴ berselletti’ are
mentioned. As many different kinds
are mentioned in this roll, it is probable
that ‘berselletti ’ and ‘berserecii ’ were
synonymous, more especially as the
terminatione, ‘ -cii ⁷ and ‘ -etti ’ were in-
terchangeable in the names of hounds.
Thus we have ‘ daimericii ’ and
‘daimeretti,’ ‘haiericii’ and ι1101010111,7
⁶ porkericii ’ and ‘ porkeretti.’

bissa (M. F. biche), a hind. the female of

the red deer. Sometimes ‘cerua’ 15
used instead of this word.

or beech. The word constantly occurs
in forest documents, and seems to have
been in use all over Enghnd, being
applied both to oak and beeches. The
