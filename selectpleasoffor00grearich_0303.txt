of Basil of Stilton, Thomas of Stiltcm, John of Sallowe of the 001110
town, John the Freeman of the same town and Robert of Stilton.

All the townships are sworn and say that they have no suspicion
concerning the taking of the buck against Ralph the parson of Syres-
ham, nor against Roget the parson of 61011011, 00 Sir Geoffrey of
Langley the justice of the forest was given to understand, nor was
the buck taken by them nor by any person who is with them.

It happened on the Wednesday ³ next after the feast of St. Peter's
Chains in the same year that William 10 Rus and Geoffrey of Pilton,
walking foresters of Weybridge, were going towards midnight to Wey-
bridge to lie in watch over their bailiwick, so that at N. towards Alcon-
bury they met a certain red greyhound worrying a doe. And they
called the said greyhound and took it. Afterwards twelve men came
following the greyhound, one of whom carried an axe in his hand, and
another a certain long stick, and the others ten bows and arrows,
And they led three greyhounds in a leash, of which one was white.
and another ticked with white and black; and of what colom· the
third was they knew not. And the foresters called the men, who
shot six arrows at the foresterS, three barbed and three ‘ genderated.⁹
And the foresters shot at the men who entered the wood. And on
account of the thickness of the wood and the darkness of the night
the foresters knew not what became of them.

Afterwards on the Sunday “¹ next following the foresters, verderers,
and four neighbouring townships‚ to wit, Alconbury WVestom Great
Stukeley and Little Stukeley, and Ellington Sibthorp assembled to
inquire who those men were, and whence they came and whither they
returned, and whose those greyhounds were, and if any one knew that
red greyhound, which was taken. And the foresters are sworn and
say upon their oath that they recognised one of those malefactors who
is called Gervais of Dene in the county of Bedford, formerly the cook
of Jeremiah of Caxton‚ and who is now with Sir John of Crakehall.
And they say that he is wont to do evil in the forest and is enrolled
in the verderers’ roll. But of the others they know nothing; but
they say that some of them were armed, but how many they knew
not.

Alconbury weston, Great Smkeley, Little Stukeley and Ellington
Sibthorp are sworn and say that they know nothing thereos.
