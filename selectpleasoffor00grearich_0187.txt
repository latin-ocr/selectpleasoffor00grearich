HUNTINGDON Ernn, An 1255 19

Little Stukeley, Woolley and Ellington did not come fully etc., there-
fore they are in mercy.

Α certain fawn was found dead in the field of Ellington. An·
inquisition was made by the townships of Ellington, Woolley, Alcon-
bury, and Brampton who know nothing thereof. And because they
did not come fully to make inquisition, therefore they are in mercy.

A certain stranger was found slain in Sapley. Richard Lenveyse
the walking forester, who was the first finder, does not come, nor was
he attached, because the verderers say and witness that they made
no attachment of the finder of the said man who died or was slain
within the metes of the forest, to wit, within the king's demesne wood,
nor were they wont at any time to make any such attachment of the
finder nor of the four neighbours, nor did they present Englishry by
reason of the assize of the forest. And because the law of the land
concerning the death of a man ought not to be abated on account of
the assize of the forest, the procedure must be according to the form

Lenveyse and a certain William of Cornwall are guilty of that death.
And ‘william was a stranger and unknown, and immediately after
that death he went away, and as yet has not returned, therefore
nothing of his outlawry; and let inquiry be made concerning him.
And let Richard be exacted and outlawed. His chattels are six-
teen pence, whereof John of Marehain the sheriff will answer.

It was presented by the foresters and verderers that the men of
Hugh the parson of Irchester came on the vigil ‘¹ of the Epiphany in
the thirtieth year with four greyhounds into the forest of VVeybridge ;
and they met the men of Simon Maufe, to wit Oliver the son of the
parson and William of Ashby, who all-took a fawn of a year old.
And the foresters coming up, that is to say Geoffrey de Mortemer‚
Hugh of Barley, Simon of Grafham, John of Coppingford, Richard
Genitas, and Richard Lenveyse came up and took the same Oliver
and William and a certain Hugh the man of the said Hugh the
parson. And Hugh escaped from the hands of the said Richard
Lenveyse, to whom he was delivered in custody, the same Rich-ard
being willing and consenting3 therefore to judgment with the said
