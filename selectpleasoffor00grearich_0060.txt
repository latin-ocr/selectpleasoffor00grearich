lii INTRODUCTION

In the same manner an order is sent to the sheriff of N orthampton that
on the day which the same justices shall make known to him he cause to

come etc. at Northampton. Witness as above.
To the sheriff 01 Oxford that at the day etc. at Oxford.

To the sheriff 01 Buckingham that at the day etc. at Buckingham.

The four justices 111 65716 began their work at Huntingdon ¹ on the
6th June, and finished it before the 20111 June, when they had arrived
at Northampton and had begun to hear pleas relating to the 1016616
01 Rockingham² and Cliffe. We cannot say how long they were so
engaged 61 Νο11116111111011, 11111 11 16 probable that they adjourned 101
6 vacation 61161 111657 had been there two or three weeks, for they can
hardly have had sufficient business to occupy their time in this way
until the 30th September when we again find them at Northampton.3
At this date they seem to have begun hearing pleas relating to the
forests 01 Whittlewood and Salcey‚ which lay partly in the county 01
Northampton and partly in the county 01 Buckingham. While at
Northampton‚ however, the justices seem to have been concerned with
those pleas only which related to the parts 01 1116 101661 ofWhittle-
wood which lay in Northamptonshire, leaving those relating 10 1116
116116 111 Buckinghamshire 101 6111166(1116111 consideration. On the other
hand, they heard all 1116 111666Ἲι relating to the parts 01 1116 101661 01
8616657 which were in Buckinghamshire as well as those which were
in Northamptonshire while they were at Northampton. The reason
101 11116 (11110161166 111 procedure may have been that considerable
portions of Whittlewood lay in both counties while nearly the whole 01
8616657 lay in the county 01 Νο11116111111011.

On the i5th November 1255, the 661116 10111 justices were at
Buckingham hearing pleas 01 1116 116116 01 111610166101 Whittlewood and
