appointed by the wardens; they were also dependent upon them
for their remuneration, for the Crown paid them no salaries.
The wardensliip of every forest which was held hereditarily carried
with it, either by prescription or by express grant, certain rights ¹
and privileges. Peter de Neville, for instance, was entitled ² to due
chiminage‚ lawing of dogs in places where it was due, and dead and
dry wood which could be collected by the hand alone without any iron
instrument in the demesne woods of the king. Robert of Everingham‚
the warden of Sherwood, enjoyed3 among other things the right to
have the bark and the crops of oaks which the king had given by his
writ 3 the right to have after-pannage as often as it occurred, and the
privilege of holding his ten knights’ fees of the king in chief exonerated
from service on account of his custody of the forest, and in return for
finding his foresters at his own cost. But the wardens‚ although
they enjoyed rights and privileges such as these, in order that they
might maintain foresters under them, were so far from paying them
anything that they themselves were actually paid by the foresters for
allowing them to exercise their office. The foresters who thus paid
an annual sarm for their offices took their own remuneratior] from
the inhabitants of the forests, by means of various acts of extortion ⁴
which they claimed as customary rights. Perhaps no better illustra-
tion of the oppression to which this system of farming the office of
forester led could be found than the list of grievances ³³ which the men

quolibet porco unum obolum.'

¹ These rights and privileges varied in
different forests. Those which the warden

(Close Roll

of Sherwood enjoyed are set out in the in-
quisition printed on pp. 66, 67 below. From
some letters close dated 2 September, 1315,
we have the rights of the warden or steward
of Galtres in Yorkshire They are as follows:

⁴ [Compertum est] quod senescalli dicte
foreste de Galtres‚ qui pro tempore
fuerunt, tarn temporibus progenitorum
nostrorum quam nostro solebant ponere et
deponere forestarios in foresta predicta pro
uoluntate sua; et quod habere solebant de
omnibus quercubus per dictos progenitores
nostros aut nos datis tannam et ramos;
et puturam suan] in foresta predicta3 et
eciam duas landas que uocantur Hanter-
wayth' et Ercedekneclos reddendo inde
annuatim dictis progenitoribus nostris et
nobis quinque solidos per manus custodis
eiusdem foreste 3 et insuper quod ad officium
senescalli ibidem pertinet habere chemi-
nagium et caplicium, reddendo inde nobis
decem solidos per annum per manus
custodis predicti; et quod habere solebant
proficuum porcorum intrancium coopertam
foreste predicte mense uetito, uidelicet, de

The warden of the forest of Galtres is in
this passage called the steward of theforest,
and the person who is described in it as
the warden of the forest is the justice ot'
the forest north of the Trent.

³ See pp. 66, 67 below.

⁴ Sometimes the foresters instead of
extorting money from the inhabitants,
wasted the king’s woods. Thus on the rolls
of the Stafford eyre oi September 1271 we
have the following entry :

‘Presentatum est . . . . quod forestarii illi
sepissime amouentur et alii in loco eorum
ponuntur per senescallum qui capit ab
unoquoque ad introitum suum magnam
summam pecunie; et preter hoc certam
summam certis terminis per annum, ex-
cepto fine facto ab unoquoque pro balliua
sua tenenda nec habent forestarii unde hoc
facere nisi de boscis balliuarum suarum.’
