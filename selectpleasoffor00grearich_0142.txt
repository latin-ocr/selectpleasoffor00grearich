'cxxxiv 1NTRonuorloi²

which the procedure to be adopted in cases of trespass in warrens
is set out in detail. Trespassers found doing damage in warren with
bows, or found with the mainour (that is to say, in possession
of hares, eoneys, or partridges)‚ or hunting, were to be attached to
come before the justices in eyre. The latter words no doubt refer to
the justices in eyre for pleas of the crown‚ and not to justices in eyre
for pleas of the forest. The words of the note are as follows:

Nota ke le Roy avera le forfeture de garreine, a ky ke la garreine seit,
e nent le seinur dela garreine: e sy le seinur amercye nul home pur coe
ke 511 est trove en sa garreyne damage sesant, 6 coe seit presente par la
deseine en eyre des J ustices, yl serra en la mercye le Roy3 mes sy 511 trove
nul home damage fesant od son arc &a en sa garreine, 511 16 fra atacher e
trover plegge de venyr devant Justice en eyre a respundre au Roy de 16
forfet. E si presente seit ke serteyne persone feseient traspas en la garreine‚
e ke 16 seynur ne les vodreit pas atacher e prendre plegge de eus, 511 sera
amercye, e nent les autres ke feseient 16 tort. E nota ke 511 ne put atacher
le cors sy 511 ne seit trove od meineure coe est saver od leverere, ou conis,
partreiz‚ &c. ou en querant, 820. Sed quaere sy 511 porra prendre ses leverres
sy eus seient en sa garreyne erranz saunz coe ke 511 eient ren pris. Si pounb,
e prendre plegges a respundre en Eyre des Justices.

But this note, written as it is in the leaves of a Year Book, and not
found elsewhere, must be read with suspicion. If it represent the law
of the land, and not merely the law as a reporter or advocate thought
it ought to be, then the law cannot have been enforced rigorously.
There is abundant evidence ¹ that lords used to impound the grey-
hounds of those who trespassed in their warrens. They had recourse
to a remedy which was inconsistent with the law as stated in the
Year Book, and apparently without any protest or interference on
the part of the king or his ministers.
