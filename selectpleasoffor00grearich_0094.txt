lxxxvi INTRODUCTION

‘ ceppi’ or stumps were found in the different demesne woods of ‘the
forest ; they merely record the total number found in the two baili-
wicks in which the demesne woods were situate. The record of the
regards continues briefly as follows:

Item uidende sunt dominice haye domini regis. Dicunt quod nichil
sciunt ; sed bene custodiuntur.

Item dicunt quod de purpresturis nec assartis factis in dominicis domini
regis nichil sciunt.

Item uidende sunt omnes aerie austurcorum speruariorum et falconum
etc. Dicunt quod nichil sciunt.l

Item uidendi sunt portus quibus applicant naues etc. Dicunt quod nichil
sciunt.

Item uidendum est mel etc. Dicunt quod I. de H. in Stanerne exarsit
in altitudine septem pedum unam quercum in dominico bosco domini regis
pro melle inuento.

Item milites debent attente inquirere etc. Dicunt quod H. de E. habet
leporarios '2 brachettos ad leporem wlpem et catum capiendum.
Item dicunt quod W. de B. habet leporarios ‘-‘ brachettos ad idem.

Nine entries similar to the last of the above conclude the original
record of this regard. Although it contains answers to several
Chapters which, as a rule, are not recorded upon the forest eyre rolls,
it contains no answer to the chapter which was concerned with forges
and mines. Moreover‚ to three of the chapters the regarders merely
answer that they know nothing. This was no doubt the answer which
was usually given to most of the chapters other than those which
asked for information about assarts, purprestures and wastes, and
greyhounds kept within the metes of the forest. When all the in-
formation which the regarders could give was that they knew nothing,
there was obviously no need for an entry on the forest eyre rolls, for
no profit to the king could arise from such an answer.

In the thirteenth century the regarders appear to have had no
duties to perform except to make the regard; but by the ‘ Ordinacio ³
Foreste’ of 1301, they were required to attend the general inquisi-
tions or swanimotes together with the forestem, verderers and agisters.
They were chosen by the sheriff on receipt of the writ which directed
a regard to be made shortly before the forest eyre. In the intervals
between the eyres, there were no elections of regarders, but at the
forest inquisitione> held after the ‘ Ordinacio ³ Foreste,’ any deficiency

¹ It is not improbable that the answers to recorded upon the eyre rolls.
this chapter were sometimes incorporated ² It is probable that the word ‘et’ is
in the paragraphs ‘ De Nouis Purpresturis ’ omitted here.
and ⁶ De Ueteribus Purpresturis ² which are ³ Statutes of the Realm, i. 147.
