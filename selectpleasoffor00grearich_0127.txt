THE CHASE, THE PARK AND THE WARREN CXlX

was it at any time one which concerned the laws of the forest. It
is possible that lords of manors enjoyed lawfully or assumed unlaw-
fully a jurisdiction in this respect. But whether they did so or
not, they certainly had no power of punishing trespassers in their
parks by imprisonment. At the parliament held on January 23,
1233 when the Provisions of Merton were enacted, the magnates
of England are said to have demanded power to imprison male-
factors taken in their parks and stews, and the king is said to have
refused their demand.¹

De malefactoribus in parcis et uiuariis non est discussum quia magnates
pecierunt propriam prisonam suam de illis, quos ceperant in parcis et
uiuariis suis; quod quidem dominus rex contradixit3 et ideo differtur.

Ten years later a new law was enacted with respect to trespasses
in parks and stews. There is no enrolment of it on the Patent or
Close Rolls, but it is recorded in the ‘Additamenta’ to the ‘ Chronica
Maiora’ of Matthew Paris. When an earl‚ a baron, or a knight
complained to the king of deer having been taken in his park, an
inquisition was to be held pursuant to a writ from the king, and
if anyone was -found guilty he was to lie in prison for a year and
a day. At the end of that term he was to be ransomed for a sum
equal to three years’ value of his lands, and he was to find twelve
pledges that he would not trespass again in parkS, stews, or forests.
Two parts oi the ransom were to belong to the king, and the remain-
ing third to the owner of the park. When the trespasser was taken
suddenly, which no doubt means when he was arrested in the act of
trespassing, the punishment was the same, but there appears to have
been no need for an inquisition. In this case the king was to have

one half the ransom only, and the owner of the park the other half.
The law is thus stated by Matthew Paris : ²

Quomodo puniuntur inuenti malefactores de parcis et uiuariis. Si fugit
et occidatur malefactor, non optinebit ius nec appellum ; si uero comes, baro,
uel miles domino regi conquestus fuerit de bestiis captis in parco suo ita
quod per breue domini regis facta fuerit inquisitio, tunc inditatus per
inquisitionem et conuictus iacebit in prisona domini regis per unum annum
et unum diem et postea redimatur ad pretium ualoris terrarum suarum per
tres annos, ita tamen quod interea de suo paupere sustentetur. Et tunc
dominus rex habebit duas partes redemptionis, et ille cui transgressus fuerit
tertiam. En post illam redemptionem inueniet duodecim plegios qui ipsum
manucapient quod deinceps non malefaciet in parcis uiuariis uel forestis, nec
