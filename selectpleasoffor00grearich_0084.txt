lxxvi INTRODUCTION
to our time. One occurs in an appendix1 to the Chronicle of Roger
of Howden, and apparently belongs to the closing years of the reign
of Henry ΙΙ. There is another in the Chartulary² of the Priory of
Worcester‚ which, although not dated, is evidently of an earlier date
than the Charter of the Forest of November 1217, and probably
was issued at the time of the forest eyre in 10 John. The third,
which became rigid, is endorsed for the first time on the Patent R011³
of 13 Henry HL, and again on many of the Close Rolls of subsequent
years.

One of the articles⁴ of the Charter of the Forest provides
that the regarders are to go through the forests to make the regard
just as it was wont to be made at the time of the first coronation of
King Henry ΙΙ. and not otherwise. Another article ⁵ provides that
the inquisition or view of lawing of dogs in the forest should be made
in future when the regard ought to be made, namely from third year
to third year. We have no means of knowing whether the regards
were made with regularity6 every third year, but the procedure, as
far as we know it, was as follows. Before the king issued a commis-
sion in eyre he sent a writ ⁷ to the sheriff‚ ordering him to cause a
regard to be made before the coming of the justices; and in the usual
writ, which was sent to the sheriff ordering him to summon all who
ought to come before the justices in eyre, there was a direction that
he should cause the regarders to come with the regards. In the eyre
rolls all the regards since the last eyre were recorded ; but they were
not enrolled each one by itself. All the regards were incorporated
in the one, which was made pursuant to the king's writ, in such
a way that it read as if there had been one regard only since the
last eyre.

The Chapters of the Regard⁸ which appear on the back of the
Patent Roll of 13 Henry HI. are twelve in number. One of them is

⁶ A few original regards exist. Among
the most interesting are three which were
presented to the justices in eyre at North-
ampton in 1256. The reference to them is
