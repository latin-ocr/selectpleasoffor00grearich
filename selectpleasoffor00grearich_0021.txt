make such a law apply to the hare throughout the length and breadth
of the vast forests of the thirteenth century would have been absurd.

Again, Manwood’s inclusion of the wolf in the class of beasts of
the forest was entirely unwarranted. The wolf is seldom mentioned
in any of our public records 3 and the passages in which we meet with
it do not support his statement. From the thirteenth year¹ of the
reign of Henry 11.‚a hunter received an annual allowance, charged
upon the sheriff's farm, for hunting wolves in the county of Wor-
cester. In a suit 2 in the king's court at Westminster in 1225 the
tenant pleaded that he held the lands demanded by the service of
catching wolves in the king’s forest. By a charter 3 dated 6 March
123} the king granted to John of Lexington the right of hunting and
taking in all the royal forest in the county of Nottingham, except the
demesne warrens, the fox, the wolf, the hare and the cat. By
letters patent ⁴ dated 14 May 1281, the king directed Peter Corbet to
take and destroy all wolves in the counties of Gloucester‚ Worcester,
Hereford, Salop and Stafford. In short, the wolf, so far from being
in any way preserved, was treated as a noxious beast which ought to
be exterminated.

Thus it may be confidently asserted that there were in general
four beasts of the forest, and four only, the red deer, the fallow deer,
the roe and the wild boar, the only exception being that in a few
districts the hare was also made the subject of the forest laws.

⁷ Occasionally, however, we may meet with passages in official docu-

ments which, if not considered carefully, might suggest that there
were in some cases less than four beasts of the forest. For example,
in a charter⁵ of the year 1212, by which king John granted to the
prior and monks of Lenton a tenth part of all his venison taken in
the counties of Nottingham and Derby, the word ammeio, or venison,
which in the middle ages was applied to the beasts of the forest, is
defined as the red deer, the fallow deer and the wild boar. Here

>the omission of the roe might suggest that this animal was not

considered as a beast of the forest in all counties. It is unfortunate
that no documents still exist which relate to the forests in Nottingham
and Derby in the reign of Henry ΠΙ. 01· his predecessore. But if the
