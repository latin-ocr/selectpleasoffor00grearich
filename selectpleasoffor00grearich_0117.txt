THERE were certain districts, such as the chases of Dartmoor,
Malvern and Cranbournc, in which the beasts of the forests were
preserved, but which were nevertheless not subject to the whole body
of the forest laws. Some of them, such as Dartmoor‚ had once been
1116 property of 1116 Crown, and had then been forests in every sense

derived from 61111166 011 1116 10116 of the 6011116 of connnon law,
instruinents recorded upon the 10116 of the Chaneery, inquisitions 011
