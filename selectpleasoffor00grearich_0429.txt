Interfecerunt duas damas per stabi-

Et fecerunt stableam inter forestam
et forincecos boscos cum equis et
hominibus (For. Proca, Tr. os Rea,
318, skt'n 6: Inq. at Marmor-ozimi, 35
Ed. iii.)-

Cum fere domini regis transeunt
metas foreste usque in schaciam domini

tenere in sch-acia sua et· sic per stabel-

staggard. According to Manwood (Forest
Lawes, ed. 1615, p. 41 v0) a staggard is
a hart of the fourth year. The word
occurs in an inquisition held at Somer-
ton on 16 June 1368, and is there spelt
⁴ stagard ’ (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rec„ 309,
skin 12). The word was not in use in
the thirteenth century.

staggus‚ a stag. Manwood defines a stag
as a hart of the fifth year (Forest
Lawes, ed. 1615, p 41 v0). On the rolls
of the Cumberland eyre of 1285 the
words ‘ unus staggus bisse’ occur (For.
Proc„ Tr. of Rec„ 5, Rozl 10). And
in some letters patent of 4 October 1341
we have ‘unus staggus unius cerui’
(Patent Rolz 206, m. 7) 3 and in a forest
inquisition of 21 April 1341 the words
‘ staggus cerui ' occur (For. Proc„ Tr.
of Rea, No. 317).

strakare, to bolt, to run off in a straight

line.

permiserunt leporarios suos currere ad
unum leporem. Et leporarii sui
strakauerunt et ceperunt unum feonem
(For. Pron„ Tr. of Rern, No. 5, Roll
10 d).

strakur. This word seems to have been

applied to dogs used for poaching. It
occurs several times in the Cuniber-
land forest eyre rolls of 15 Ed. i.
(For. Proc„ T‘r. of Rea, No. 5).

per unum strakur saluum (Rolz 5).
cum uno stracur nigro (Rozl 5).

cum dnobus lepor-ariis . . . et 011111
uno strakur griseo (Rom 7 d).
strakur (Rozz 10).

cum duobus leporariis strakurs (Roll
12 d).

stub. In modern English this word is

applied to a stump from which under-
wood 15 grown3 but it was probably
used of pollard trees in the middle
ages. In the prices of vert for which
the vei-defers accounted in the Notting-
ham forest eyre of 1334, that of the
stub is too high for it to refer to a
stump which could be of little value.
It should be noticed, too, that the word
‘ robur' which probably meant pollard,
15 not found in this list. There is a
parcel of documents at the Record Office
labelled ‘Augmentations, Accounts of
Woods, One Parcel, Hen. viij! It
contains a book in manuscript with a
paper cover, entituled ‘ Presentmentes
of the preservators of woodis. De
tempore regine Elizabethe.’ In this
book at f. 3 r‘2, we have :

one stubbe wherin was one tonne
and a half of tymber, the which we
counte altogether worthe iijs. iiijd.;

and again on the same folio :

one stubbe the which was broken a
littell before havinge thetin ij tonnes
of tymber which we count worth vs. the
tonne and also the brushe of the sanie
tree iiij0¹· lodes of fewell wood which we
esteme worthe viijd. the tonne.

On f. 78 r⁰ of the same book, we have :
one grene stubb oke.

The words ‘robur' and ‘stub⁷ both
occur in the account of the year 29
Ed. i. mentioned under robur above.
It is clear, therefore, that the two
words had not precisely the same
meaning.
