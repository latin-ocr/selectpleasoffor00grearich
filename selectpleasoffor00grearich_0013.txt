PREFACE

THE text of this volume consists for the most part of extracts from
the eyre 10116 of the tenth year of the reign of John and of the latter
half of the reign of Henry ΙΙΙ. Τ116 1661 consiste of forest inquisitione,
upon which some of the eyre 10116 printed in this volume were based,
some perambulations of the reign of Edward I. and 6 few other
11116661161160116 documents. The MSS. relating to Essex (pp. 69—74)

The Introduction is confined to 6 description of the forest laws
of the thirteenth century3 and it has been found impossible to deal
with every branch of them, even within this limited period. No docu-
ments explaining the rights of common enjoyed by the inhabitants of
the forests are printed in this volume, nor is any account given of them
in the Introduction. Common is a large subJ‘ect, and in the judgment
of the editor it is not convenient to 11661 common in forests apart
from common elsewhere.

The Glossary includes words used in documents relating to the
forest administration even though they are not mentioned in the text
of this volume. Numerous examples 616 printed in it which illustrate
the use and purpose of the hounds used in the middle ages, but 611
attempt to sh'ow their relation to hounds of modern times is deemed
to lie outside the scope of this work.

The editor has to thank Mr. J. H. Willis for 6 valuable note on
one of the words mentioned in the Glossary; Mr. Hemy Bmdley, of
Exeter College, Oxford‚ and Mr. Victor Kastncr, professor of the French
