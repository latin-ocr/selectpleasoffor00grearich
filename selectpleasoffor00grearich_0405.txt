fortune to make fine. The foresters, riding and walking, and their
pages take likewise with respect to a cart two shillings, three shillings,
four shillings‚ from some more and from others less, according to their
means, and from a horse which carries a load twelve pence, eighteen
pence and sixteen pence to 16166 111611 fine which they have made with
their chief forester, to the great destruction of the forest of the king,
and to the grievance of those who have woods in the forest, for they
suffer the carriers to go quit all through the year without attachment
and yet the king has no profit.

9. Although the charter says that nothing shall be taken except
from those who carry wood outside 1116 bailiwicks of the foresters, and
that nothing shall be taken from those who carry upon their backs
wood, bark, or charcoa] even though they live thereby, and though
the charter says that no chiminage is 10 be given except from the
demesne wood of the king, yet where the people rest with their wood
01 timber and unload it from 66116 outside the close of the franchise
of the Charterhouse among the towns, and afterwards take up their
loads 01 this same wood or timber, the foresters attach them and
amerce them grievously at their will without right⁰

Exmoor.

10. The foresters attach likewise the good folk in their demesne
woods and in their demesne lands and amerce them grievously and
the small folk they attach at their homes and in their enclosures and
in their crofts among the towns; and the men who work in their waste
ground at making ‘hoes' to sow corn, although the king 1166 110
demesne, these their foresters attach to come before them ; and they say
that they have made waste and purpresture‚ if they do not their will,
for having peace; and from each man holding land they will have
the skin of a lamb or a sarthing; and they say that that is their 166.

11. And if a man bring the timber of a house a hundred years old,
be it more or less, from one place to another, from whatsoever place it
come, without or within the forest, or an old chest without iron, or 6
pair 01 wheels for a waggon or a cart, 66 merchants are wont to do to
a fair, from whatsoever place they come they attach them in the
middle of the king’s highway and sometimes in the middle of the
market 6611 101 chiminage until they have made fine at their will,
whereby the country feels itself much aggrieved. And they pray our
lord the king that all such things and grievances may be amended,
seeing that the king from such things has no profit.
