NORTHAMPToNsrnRE, An. 125} 112

An inquisition was made at Oundle before Arnold de Bois, the
justice of the forest, on the day ‘² of Saints Fabian and Sebastian in
the same year by the foresters and verderem, who say upon their oath
that Guy . . . on the Tuesday next after the feast of St. Thomas the
Martyr . . . went to Lilford to his dinner, and as he went [he saw] a
buok's broket dragging a stake, with a cord fastened to its feet. And
it fied towards the wood and entangled itself between two trees and
was taken. And the said Guy went away to his dinner‚ and caused
Roger of Pontefraet, who was then his page, to wait there watohing
seoretly to see if anyone wished to carry away that deer. And im-
mediately afterwards Nicholas and Simon, the sons of Sweyn of
Lyveden, and Simon the woodward of Sir Maurice Daundelay came
and carried away that deer. And the said Roger demanded some
part thereos from them; but they gave nothing to him. And the
venison aforesaid was carried to the house of Bate of Pilton and
eaten there.

And they say that on Monday⁴ the morrow of St. Andrew the
Apostle Sir Hugh of Goldingham, the steward of the forest, came
away from the swanimote of Cliffe, passing across the middle of the'
forest of Cliffe through the bailiwiok of Morehay. And then suddenly
and unexpeotedly there arose before him and his men with bows and
arrows Hugh le Moin, the parson of Thurning, Philip the tailor‚ who
was with Berenger le Moin, Geoffrey of Wadenhoe, William the son of
the parson of Thornhaugh, Richard Seroty of Upthorp‚ John Seroty,
his brother, Geoffrey Duke of Upthorp‚ Robert J ouoe of Lyveden . . .
of Borough‚ and Bate of Lyveden, who are all evil doers in the forest
of the lord king to his venison.

They say also that Henry the nephew of the dean of Oundle,
Robert the parson of Polebrook‚ William of Burgh‚ the parson of
Bai-nack, the parson of Yaxley, and Elias of Thornhaugh are harbourers
of the said evil doers.

And they say that Ralph Iuelhering of Lowick and Walter the son
of Robert Perehead are evil doers to the venison of the lord king
in the bailiwiek of Roekinghan1; and elsewhere with bows and arrows
