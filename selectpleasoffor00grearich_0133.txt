THE OHASE, THE PARK AND THE WARREN CXXV

It was the usual practice for the king to restrict his grants of
warren to the demesne lands of his subjects. If anyone appropriated
a right of warren over the lands of his free tenants or neighbours he
was considered to have abused his franchise and was liable to lose it
and be amerced in the king's courts. When landowners were sum-
moned to show by what warrant they claimed free warren in their
demesne lands and were able to show a good title, the king's attorneys
often raised the further objection that the franchise had been enlarged
in this way, and the question was then submitted to a jury.l Nor was
enlargement the only way in which the right of warren might be
abused. It seems that the owner of a warren was obliged to keep a
warrener or warden to prevent people hunting in it without his licence;
for like other franchises a warren might be forfeited by non-user.
J ollan de Neville was summoned ² before justices in eyre at N ottingham
in November 1329 to show by what wari-ant he claimed free warren in
his demesne lands of Rolleston. He produced a chartei· of Edward Ι.
granting him the right. Thereupon the king's attorney said that
he had abused his right. A jury found that he had not guarded his
warren and, without even his licence being sought and obtained, had
permitted anyone who would to hunt there at his own pleasure. It
was then adjudged that J ollan should lose his warren.³

The forfeiture of ten pounds to which persons who hunted in
warrens without the licence of their owners were liable belonged to
the king. In many cases suits were brought in the king's courts by
landowners against trespassers in their warrens. When judgment
was in favour of the plaintiff, it declar-ed that he should recover his
damages against the defendant, and that the king should have his ten
pounds of forfeiture. Thus, the finding of the jury and the judgment
in a case of trespass in a warren is recorded on the rolls ⁴ of the King's

Bench for Trinity term 1305 as follows ε

with the soil of the warren to an assignee.
(Rolls of Parliammt, p. 98.)

¹ At an eyre in Lincolnshire in 9 Ed. i.
it was proved that the lord had enlarged
his warren, and he was thereupon amer-ced ;

‘ Et quoad elargacionem warenne dicunt
quod ipse [Willelmus] tenet in warennam
omnes terras libere tenencium suorum infra
dictum manerium. Ideo consideratum est
quod decetero non capiat aliquas emendas
pro predictis transgressionibus; et quod
terre predictorum libere tenencium suorum
infra. predictum manerium suurn sint de
cetero extra warennam. Et Willelmus in
misericordia.’ (Placz'tu de Quo ll'aranto

p. 395. See also ibid. pp. 441, 397.)

² Placito. cle Quo Waranlo, p. 618.

³³ At the same eyre other lords lost their
warrens through non-user. Thus we have :

‘ Et quoad warennam in dominicis terris
suis in W. dicit quod idem H. non posuit
custodem ibi pro illa warenna custodienda
set quemlibet pro uoluntate sua permisit in
eadem fugare licencia ipsius H. non optenta.
Ideo predicta libertas warenne habende in
dominicis terris suis de W. capiatur in
manum domini regis.’ (Ibid. p. (340. Sei·
also ibid. p. 639.)
