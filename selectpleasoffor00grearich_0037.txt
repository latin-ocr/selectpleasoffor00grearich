intelligible if we translate ‘ suanimotum ’ by the words ‘ forest
assembly,’ which do not suggest any particular jurisdiction.

But, not content with asserting that there was a distinct court
called the court of swanimote which sat at regular intervals, Manwood
went so far as to describe ¹ its jurisdiction. He says ε

The court of attachments cannot determine any offence or trespass of the
forest, if the value of the same trespass be above the value of four pence, but
that the same offence and trespass, if the value be more than four pence
must be by the said verderers inrolled in their roll and so to be sent from
thence to the swanimote to have an orderly trial of the same there according

to the laws of the forest.

On another page 2 he says ε

It is to be understood that the court of swanimote is a court of the forest,
which should be holden three times in the year as is aforesaid for to enquire
of vert and venison and other trespasses that are done within the forest ; and
there all the trespasses of the forest shall be enquired of and presented.

These extracts show that he thought that the swanimote was a
court held three times a year for the purpose of trying certain
offences adjourned from the court of attachments and of inquiring
into and receiving presentments of all trespasses and offences against
the forest laws. His notion that this court was held three times
a year was taken from the Charter3 his description of its juris-
diction was derived from other sources which will be discussed
presently.

The three days in every year on which Manwood thought that

the Charter authorised the holding of a court of swanimote were
‘ at the beginning of the fifteen days before the feast of St. Michael‚

when the agisters assemble to agist our demesne woods' ; and ‘ about
the feast of st. Martin, when our agisters ought to receive our
pannage’ ; and ‘ at the beginning of the fifteen days before the feast
of St. John the Baptist‚ for the fawning of our beasts.’ If courts of
swanimote, having the jurisdiction and powers which Manwood
ascribed to them, were to be held three times fa year only, the days
appointed for them were sti-angely chosen. Is it to be supposed that
offences against the forest laws, were committed most frequently at
the season of pannage and when the king’s deer were fawning‘.) If
such a court was required at regular intervals, should we not expect
to find one during the winter months, when trespassers would go by
night into the woods to take logs for fuel, timber for shelter and
