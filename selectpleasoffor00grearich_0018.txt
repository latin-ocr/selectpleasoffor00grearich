possess lands within the bounds of a forest, but were not allowed the
right of hunting or 01 cutting trees in them at their own will.

The history 01 1116 English forests may conveniently be divided
into three periods‚ 01 which the first extended from the earliest times
till 1217, the year 01 1116 granting 01 1116 Charter 01 1116 Forest3 the
second from 1217 till 1301, when large tracts were disafforested by
king Edward I.; and the third from 1301 till the present day.
This volume is concerned chiefly with the second of these periods3 101
1111111 11115 1165 been studied in detail it will be impossible, owing to
lack 01 documents to (10 111016 111611 make conjectures about the earlier
period; and after 1301 1116 whole forest administration was from
various causes in a state 01 decay.

In the forests the red deer and the fallow deer were strictly pre-
sei-ved,l as were also certain other animals 3 but to ascertain which
these were will require some consideration. Manwood in his ‘ Treatise
on the Forest Laws‚’ which was written 2 at the end 01 1116 sixteenth
century, declared that there were five beasts 01 1116 forest, the hart,
the hind, the hare, the wild boar and the wolf: in other words, the
red (1661,1116 hare, the wild boar and the wolf, the hart and the
hind being respectively the male and female 01 1116 red deer. But
although Manwood did not include the 1611011Ὗ (1661· 111 1116 61655 01

marten and the roe, which he called beasts 3 01 1116 611656. Τ116 law,
however, recognised no such distinction between the red deer and the
fallow deer3 101 11 1116 words ‘beasts 01 1116 forest' have any legal
significance, they must refer to those beasts which are the particular
subject 01 1116 forest laws, and as the laws relating to the red deer were
precisely the same 65 111056 relating to the fallow deer, both species
ought to be placed in the same class.

Again, Manwood's exclusion of the roe from the beasts 01 1116
101651, although true in his own time, was not true of the period under
our consideration. During the thirteenth century the roe was the
subject 01 1116 forest laws in all parts 01 England. But in the
thirteenth year 01 1116 reign of Edward ΠΙ. 1116 court 01 1116 King's
