THE FOREsT OFFICERS xix
on the death of John of Fransham 116 granted it to John Pikard ¹ for
life without any such consent.

The wardens were the executive Officers of the king in his forests.
Writs relating to the administration of forest business, as well as to
the delivery of 111-6661116 of venison and wood, were, in general, ad-
dressed to them. They also attended the various courts of the forest.
It does not appear, however, that their presence at any of them was
necessary.

'I'he Verderers.

The wardens were not the only officers of the forest in direct
relation with the Crown. In all the 1016616, except those in the
county palatine of Cheshire, there were Officers called verderers ² who
were responsible to the king and not to the wardens. Like coroners,
verderers were elected in the county court, the elections being made
upon the receipt by the sheriff 01 a writ3 called ‘ de uiridario eligendo.’
When elected they held office for life unless they were removed by the
Crown ε an event which frequently happened in the fourteenth,
but not often in the thirteenth century. The Close Rolls 01 1116 reign
of Edward ΠΙ. supply numerous examples of verderers being removed
from their office, sometimes because they were incapacitated by age or
11111666, and at others because they were insufficiently qualified. The
qualification was the possession of land within the forest, but it is
probable that the particular quantity of land was not fixed, but lay
in the discretion 01 1116 Crown. As a rule the verderers were either
knights 01· persons possessed of considerable landed property. They
received no salary‚ and no perquisites were attached to their office;

¹ John Pikard was appointed by letters

nostre de G. in comitatu predicto adeo
patent dated 15 May 1276. (See Patent

languidus et senio contractus existit quod

 

Roll 94, m. 23.)

² Verderers are seldom mentioned in
doeuments of the early years of the reign
01 John. The first instance 01 1116 word
‘uiridarius ’ in the charter rolls is in a
charter dated 21 January 1213. (Rotuba
Chartarum‚ p. 204.) If the word occurs at
all in the charters or on the pipe rolls of the
reign 01 Rich. 1., it must be very rarely. It
will be noticed that they are mentioned in
the rolls 01 1116 eyre 01 10 John (see pp. 3,
4, 7, 8), and in the Charter 01 1116 Forest,
1217, they are evidently an integral part 01
1116 forest hierarchy.

³ The following is the form of the writ
sent 10 1116 sheriff ordering an election ι

‘Rex uicecomiti Lincoln’ 616. Quia N.
de H. unus uiridariorum nostrorum foreste

ad ea que ad officium uiridariorum in
eadem foresta pertinent exercendum labor-
are non potest ut accepimus, tibi precipimus
quod si ita est, tunc in pleno comitatu tuo
de assensu eiusdem comitatus loco predicti
N. eligi facias unum alium uiridarium, qui
prestito sacramento prout moris est extunc
ea faciat et conseruet que ad officium uiri-
darii pertinent in foresta predicta. Et talem
eum eligi facias qui melius sciat et possit
officio illi intendere. Et nomen eius nobis
scire facias. Teste rege 616.7 (Reqistrum
Omnium Bmvz'um, 1595, p. 177 v0.)

In the thirteenth century the king some-
times directed the warden 01 a forest to
substitute a verderer 101· 0116 dischaiged,
instead of directing the 61161111 tocause a new
one to 116 elected. (See Close Boll 65, m. 8).
