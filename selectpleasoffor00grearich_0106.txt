sheriff of Northumberland‚ and on 1 May 1225 10 1110 01101111 01 Rut-
land.1 It is probable that they were also sent at different dates to
the sheriffs of other counties in which there were forests. On 8 May
in the same year the justices were directed ² to cause the Charter of
the Forest to be observed in the different counties according to the
perambulations which they had already made. In the counties in
which perambulations3 had not yet been made, it was to be observed
according to 1110 perambulations as soon as they were made. In the
case of Rutland a special mandate ⁴ was sent to the jastice of the forest
on 5 August ordering him to observe the perambulation just as it had
been made, but to retain in the king’s hands his demesne woods 01
Oakham and Ridlington.

Although the Charter was made in the name and under the seal
01 1110 king, he was still an infant, and the ordinance in restraint
of perpetuity had not been revoked. Early in January 1227 1110
king declared ⁵ that he was 01 full age.‘⁵ On the 22nd of that month
he made⁷ his first grant in perpetuity‚ having on the previous
day proclaimed 1157 1011010 addressed to the 011011110, 11101 110 would
cause charters and confirmations to be made under his seal, and
ordered that all who had or claimed to have lands, tenements or
liberties by the gift or grant and confirmation of his antecessors
should come forthwith to show 1157 what warrant they claimed them.

chase charters or confirmations 01 1011110, tenements, markets,
liber-ties or anything whatever should come to him for that purpose.
For some months the clerks in the chancery were exceptionally busy.
New charters were granted, and old ones were confirmed. Every
grant raised a question 01 expediency, and every confirmation 0110 01
validity. It was a time 01 inquiry into the king’s rights and property.

It is not surprising that the young king on attaining his political
majority, challenged8 some 01 1110 disafforestments which had been

corded upon the Close 11011οῑ namely,

⁶ The attestations 01 letters patent and
close show that the king was at Oxford on
8, 9, 10 ,1011110157 122ξ. According to the
Annals 01 Worcester, he declared that the
was 01 11111 age on 9 January. (Amzales
Monastr'ci, Rolls Series, vol. iv. p. 419.)

1110 king had declared his majority it had
been decided that there should be a re-
vision 01 1110 perambulations. On 27 Sep-
tember 1226 1110 0111101 01 Abingdon and
seven other persons were ordered to bring
before the king the charters 01 1110 king’s
predecessors under which they claimed
liberties in the forest and the disafforested
districts. On 26 October the perambula-
tions 01 certain 1010010 were temporarily
revoked. (Rot. Litt. Claus. ii. 156. See
