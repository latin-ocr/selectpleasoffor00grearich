Grievances against the chartei· of the forest.

Whereas our lord the king wishes and has commanded and caused
to be published by his council that the charter of 1110 101001 be
observed in all respects in all its articles without blemish‚ these are
the grievances, whereby the people and the commonalty 01 1110 1010010
111 Somerset feel themselves aggrieved against the charter.

1. Although the charter says that all the forests which king
Henry grandfather of the king Henry the son of king John afforested
010 10 110 viewed by good and lawful men, and 11 110 1100 01101001οᾰ
01157 wood other than his own to 1110 damage of him to whom 1110
wood belongs, it is to be disafforested; and that 011 1110 woods which
were afforested by king Richard or by king John before the first
001011011011 01 king Henry father of our lord the king Edward 010 10
110 disafforested, yet they still 101110111 111 1110 101001 against the chartei·
10 1110 grievance of the country. The above are the ancient bounds
in 1110 111110 01 king Henry 1110 father 01 1110 king Richard and the
king John, as 1110 perambulation 01 1110 aforesaid forests 10110 110, from
bound to bound. And all the woods, which 010 outside, 10 1110 griev-
ance of 1110 country and most sinfully have been afforested, for the
king has outside no demesne and no profit; moreover 1110 country is
surcharged thereby most grievously with foresters and their pages and
their horses, although the chief forester ought to be charged with
them in return for the 1011ᾶο and tenements which he holds of 1110 king.

2. And though 1110 charter says that archbishops, bishops‚
01111010, priors, 00110, 11010110, knights and free tenants‚ who have
woods in the forest, may have their woods as they were 01 1110 111110
01 1110 first coronation 01 1110 king Henry 1011101 01 the king Richard
and John, so that they may be quit for ever of 011 purprestures
wastes and assarts made in those woods since 11101 111110 1111 1110
commencement of the second year of the coronation of the king
Henry the son of king John, yet 01 every eyre of the justices of the
forest are the people who have woods in the 101001 grievously
punished for purprestures wastes and 0000110 01 1110 aforesaid time.
