THE ansE, Tus PARK AND Tun wARRtN cxvii

The effect of the forest laws was to give the king a certain right of
property in the beasts of the forest, which, as we have seen, were
described as the king’s venison. When he partially disafforested a
wood or a piece of land, he frequently reserved his venison by such
words as ‘salua nobis uenacione nostra.’ At other times he would
entirely disafforest a district and grantby express words that its
owner should be at liberty to make a park 01 11. In such cases the
11011010 01 the forest, as soon as they entered the park, became beasts
serae naturae unprotected by the forest law, and the owner of the
park might lawfully kill them for his own use. Every grant of
liberty to impark carried with it the obligation of keeping the park
properly enclosed, so that the king might not lose his beasts in
consequence 01 his grant.

Outside the forests the owners 01 neighbouring lands were in the
habit of imparking them and making certain contrivances called
⁴ deer leaps ' or saltatoria, which were 01 011011 a nature as to enable
the beasts of the forest to enter the pai-k and to prevent them from
coming out again. If, however, the deer leap was within a short
distance of the forest, it would be presented to the justices 111 eyre as
a nuisance to the forest, and they would then order it to be removed.
The precise distance within which a deer leap was considered a
nuisance to a forest is a matter of doubt.¹ At the Cumberland
forest eyre of 1285, a presentment² was made that Isabel of Clifford
held a park in which there were two (1001· leaps, nuisances to the
forest, one being a league and the other a league and a half dis-
tant from it.

Isabella de Clifford, que est una heredum Roberti de Ueteri ponte
defuncti tenet parcum (le wanneseld in comitatu Westmerl’ ubi sunt duo
saltoria3 ad nocumentum foreste de eo quod unum non distat a foresta
⁴domini regis de Inglewod' per unam leucam et aliud distat fere per unam
leucam et dimidiam, quorum Iohannes de Ueteri ponte pater Robcrti de
Ueteri ponte fecit unum et Robertus predictus fecit aliud; 01 aliud elongauit
ad nocumentum foreste domini regis predicte. Et testatum fuit quod

‘Et Hugo per attor-natum suum uenit 01

boscum quod continet quadraginta acras
iuxta curiam suam ubi nullus comunicare
debet nec comunicauit a tempore quo

¹ At an inquisition held at 5001011011 00

21 February 136} the forest Officers and
jurors made the following statement:

‘Quod in parco de Cormalet sunt duo
saltatoria, qui quidem parcus non distat a
dicta foresta tres lcucas; et male includitur
ad nocumentum ferarum domini regis et
contra assisam foreste.’ (For. Proc., Tr.
of Rea, No. 309, Skin 13.)
