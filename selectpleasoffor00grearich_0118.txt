justices in eyre for pleas of the forest. Some of the king’s rights
with respect to the preservation of the beasts of the forest and the
timber became vested in the new proprietor. The mere grant of the
forest effected no such disafforestment as to enable its inhabitants to
hunt and cut their timber at pleasure. In general, the restrictione
under which they had lived continued, and it was only the machinery
by which they were enforced that was altered.

The lord of a chase seems to have had the right of arresting
through his foresters all persons found trespassing against the venison,
and detaining them in prison until they made satisfaction, provided
that they were taken in the act, or, in legal language, provided that
they were taken ‘with the 11131110111·.’ This at least was stated in 3
case in 0110 of the principal courts of common law in the reign of
Edward Ι. Τ110 enrolment of the proceedings is printed by Coke in
the fourth part of his ‘Institutes of the Laws of England,’¹ but
unfortunately owing to a wrong reference the original cannot be found.

Ricardus de Cornubia et 11011011] 3111 attachiati fuerunt ad respondendum
Iohanni de Sallaye quare ipsun] ceperunt et in prisona detinuerunt per
decem septimanas apud castrum de Knaresburgh’ etc.

Ricardus et alii dicunt quod castrum et honor de Knaresburgh cum
foresta de Bestagne fuit aliquando in seisina domini Henrici regis patris
domini regis nune et eo tempore fuit talis consuetudo in foresta predicta
quod si quis indictatus fuerit per forestarios coram seneschallo eiusdem
honoris de transgressione de uei acione facta in eadem foresta idem senes-
challus tales transgressores ubicunque fuerint inuenti infra eandem liber-
tatem predicti honoris licite potest arrestare et- imprisonare et eos in prisona
detinere quousque satisfecerint de transgressione etc. Qui rex Henricus
dedit predictum honorem 01111] foresta etc. Ricardo fratri suo comiti
Cornubie patri Edmundi comitis Cornubie qui toto tempore suo usus est
tali libert-ate arrestandi etc.

Iohannes e contra dicit nullam talem fuisse consuetudinem arrestandi
malefactores nisi quando capti fuerunt cuni manuopere et hoc ab antiquiore
tempore quia idem comes non habet ibidem forestam sed chaceam tantuin.
Et quod tempore willelmi de Stoteuill’ domini dicte chacee qni dedit regi
Iohanni dictam 0113003111 et tempore dicti regis Iohannis et tempore regis
Heni-ici patris dum dicta chacea fuit in manu sua nunquam arrestauerunt
aliquos de transgressione in chacea illa nisi illos qui capti fuerunt cum
manuopere et hoc offert uerificare per patriam eto.

Ideo preceptum est uicecomiti quod summoneat predictum comitem etc.

Again, a similar right seems to 113Ῡο been exercised by the lord of
the free chase of 111311το111, for in a memorandum,2 which is printed in
