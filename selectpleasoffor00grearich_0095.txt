THE REGARD lxxxvii

in their number was supplied by persons who were appointed regarders
for a day only.

No salary attached to the office of a regarder, but it is probable
that the expenses of the regard fell upon the inhabitants of the forest.
In an inquisition held at Farnham in 42 Edward ΙΙΙ.1 the jurors
make the following declaration :

Item dicunt quod abbas de Wauerle a tempore sine memoria tenetur
inuenire apud Dakkenfeld’ forestariis et regardatoribus domini regis in
regardo faciendo unum repastum, herbergagium 2 per unam noctem, fenum

, et auenas pro equis eorum.

VI.
THE CLERGY

THERE was a special procedure for clerks3 accused of felonies in
the King's court differing from that which obtained in the case of
laymen similarly accused. So, too, there was a special procedure for
clerks accused of trespasses in the forestse Hem-y IL, it is true,
evidently desired to have a uniform procedure for poachers whether
clerks or laymen 3 although in this respect his policy was ultimately
unsuccessful. As early as the year 1176 we find him writing ‘¹ to the
pope, Alexander HL, declaring that he had made certain concessions
to the papal legate, The first of these was as follows:

Uidelicet quod clericus de cetero non trahatur ante iudicem secularem in
persona sua de aliquo criminali, neque de aliquo forisfacto, excepto forisfacto

foreste mee, et excepto laico feodo unde michi vel alii domino seculari laicum
debetur seruitium,

Again, the assize of Woodstock, which, according to Dr. Stubbs, was
issued in 1184, contained this provision ε ⁵

Item rex defendit quod nullus clericus ei forisfaciat de uenacione suanec de
forestis suis ; precepit bene forestariis suis quod si inuenerint eos forisfafflentes,

non dubitent in eos manum ponere, ad eos retinendum et attachiandum ; et
ipse eos bene warantizabit.
