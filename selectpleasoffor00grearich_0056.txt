xlviii INTRODUCTION
can only be ascertained from a careful study of the dates 01
inquisitions in other 1016616. Fewer inquisitious, however, held in
other 1016616 11616 6111111611 10 1116 present day than is the case in the
forest of Windsor.

Genera] inquisitions, such as those just described, were certainly
not the swanimotes authorised by the Charter ofthe Forest. The
swanimotes there mentioned were to be held three times a year at
specified dates3 and certain forest Officers and none other were to be
distrained to come to them. On the other hand, the general
inquisitions were held at irregular 1111611616 ; and they were usually
made before the justice of the forest by the regarders and a body of
ι1111016 66 well as by 13116 Officers mentioned in the Charter, Moreover
the authorised swanimotes were clearly 1101 intended to form an
essentia] part of the forest procedure, 66 they were not to be held
except in those counties in which they were wont to be held ¹ ; but the
general inquisitions of the fourteenth century were held in 611 1116
0011111166 111 which there were forests and formed the basis of the
forest procedure.

Itis probable that the wardens of 1116 reign of John were in the
habit 01 summoning the inhabitants ancl officers 01 their forests 10
001116 10 6666111111166, called swanimotes‚ 101 110 011161· purpose than that
of amercing those who failed to come. To check this abuse the
Charter declared that swanimotes were only to be held on certain
occasions and in a particular manner. The inquisition by four
neighbouring townships may have been an existing institution
which was not intended2 to be abolished by the Charter, or it may
have been introduced shortly after the grant 01 1116 Charter, 66 611
institution without which the beasts 01 1116 101661 could not be pre-
served. But, however it 61066, 11 was· well established in the middle
of the reign 01 Henry ΙΙΙ., and it was as a development of these in-
quisitions by the four townships that the general inquisition came into
being.

The following is an example of a general inquisition, of the year
1369 :

found dead or maimed. They complained

that notwithstanding the Charter the

of chapter eight of the Charter of the

For-est printed on p. xxviii above.

² The terms of the complaints made by
the inhabitants of the Forest 01 Mendip in
the year 1277, seem 10 show that they did
not consider that the Charter of the horest
prohibited inquisitions by four neighbour-
ing townships when a beast had been

wal-(len was in the habit of summoning the
freemen and townships to inquisstions,
‘although there is no beast dead or
maimed nor any lawsul indictment by a
forester or any other certain man accord-
ing to the assize of the forest' (see p. 127
below).
