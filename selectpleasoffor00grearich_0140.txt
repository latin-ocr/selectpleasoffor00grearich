by letters patent¹ dated 4 April 1252, Henry ΠΙ. granted William
Gernun lic-enee to hunt the hare, the fox, and the cat throughout the
forest of Essex, except in the king's demesne warrens and the warrens
of other persons. As no law prevented people from entering warrens
in pursuit of beasts which were not beasts of the warren, it may fairly
be assumed that the exceptions of the king’s warren and the warrens
of onher persons were made because the animals for which the
licence to hunt was given were beasts of the warren. We cannot
suppose that the king would derogate from his own grant by
conferi-ing an exclusive right of hunting certain beasts in a particular
district upon one individua] and afterwards granting liberty to
another individua] to hunt the same beasts in the same district.
These licences to hunt usually referred to the forr, the hare, and the
cat,2 but occasionally other animals were mentioned. Thus, on the
25th October 1252 the king granted3 Walter Baskerville licence to
hunt the hare, the fox, the cat and the badger in the foreste
of Herefordshire, Oxfordshire‚ Gloucestershire and EsseX. There
are also instances in which the wolf⁴ and even the squirrel⁵ were
included in such licences.

The fowls of the warren, on the other hand, were certainly not
noxious birds. There seems, however, to be no reason for supposing
that they consisted of a few easily enumerated species. We have
already noticed cases in which the plover and the lark were treated
as fowls of the warren. It is not improbable that all birds which
were taken by snares, hounds or hawks were considered to belong to
the same class.

The creation of every new warren lessened the opportunity which
the inhabitants of adjoining lands had enjoyed of hunting at their
pleasure. It is therefore not surprising that the large number
of charters of warren granted by Henry ΙΙΙ. gave rise to a complaint
at the parliament of Oxford in 1258. One of the articles6 of the

² There is other authority for the cat being
a beast of warren. In 9 Ed. i. the bishop
of Salisbury was summoned before the
king's justices at Marlborough to show
why he claimed warren in Ramsbury. In
his reply the king's attorney expressly
stated that the fox. the hare and the cat
belonged to warren:

(Planta. de Quo Waranbo, p. 804.)

By a chartei· dated 28 April 1228, the
king granted to Roger of Clifford warren in
certain lands for the fox, the hare and the
eat. (Charter Roll 20, m. 6.)

⁵ By letters patent dated 15 January
12523 the king granted to John of Lexington

and the squirrel in the forest of Essex.
