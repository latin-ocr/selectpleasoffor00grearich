NORTnAMi‘ToNsanE, An 12:35 115

Fulk of Geddington came about the third hour into the park of BJig-
stock at Stockfoldhill above Osbern Riding. And so he perceived a
bowman with a bow and arrows, and a page with him, who had taken
a deer which lay in front of them. And they wished to shoot at the
said Thomas, and 116 fled, but he does not know who the men were.
Afterwards the same Thomas on the same day towards night came
to Richard of Horton and Robert the son of Robert of Gedding-
ton and showed them what had happened, so that the three
watched outside the town of Geddington, to see in concealment if any-
0116 brought the flesh towards the town of Geddington. And then
Roger the cleik, of the same town, came ; and so outside the town they
found Hugh Kydelomb of Geddington with four shoulders of venison‚
which he had retained, and one head of a buck with the whole neck,
and one head of a doe with the whole neck. And they demanded of
the same page whence he had the said venison3 and he said that
some men with bows gave it to him in the wood on the same day,
but who the men with bows were he knew not.

Afterwards they entered the town and Richard of Horton stood
at his door, so that he saw William of Warmington‚ the brother of
William of Warmington, entering the town with a bow and arrows
together with a page who rode upon a sorrel horse with white feet
and carried venison. The aforesaid boy on horseback, when he per-
ceived the aforesaid Richard‚ left his horse and fied. And the afore-
said William mounted his horse and crossed Geddington bridge with
the venison, and entered the lane towards the house of William of
VVarmington, his brother.

Afterwards an inquisition was made at Geddington on the Sunday ¹
next after the feast of St. Mathew the Apostle before Sir Geoffrey
of Lewknor‚ Hugh of Goldingham, and Richard of Aldwinkle and
William of the chamber‚ the verderers‚ by four townships‚ Geddington,
Boughton, Weeffley, and Little Newton, who came and, being sworn,
said upon their oath that they knew nothing thereof; but they rather
thought that it was false than true.

Richard of Horton acknowledged that the aforesaid Thomas had a
6110111061· of the aforesaid Hugh Kydelomb 3 and that the said Thomas
gave part thereof to the same Richard to eat.
