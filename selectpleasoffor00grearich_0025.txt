THE 10111151 0111105115 xvii
Pecche was the warden of five forests‚ all situate in different parts of
the county 01 Somerset. Similarly all the forests in the counties 01
Northampton, Huntingdon, Oxford and Buckingham were grouped
together and subject to a common warden, who was styled the
warden or steward of the 1016515 between the bridges of Stamford
and Oxford. These forests, it is true, were in places contiguous to
one another; but each 01 1116111 had its own name and for many
purposes was treated as a distinct forest bailiwick.

There were two classes of wardens: the one appointed by letters
patent under the great seal, holding office during the king's pleasure;
the other hereditary wardens. XVhen the king appointed a warden by
letters patent, he usually appointed him at the 531116 111116 1116 11311161]
01 3 particular castle within the forest. Thus the 113111611 01 1116 635116
of Rockingham and the warden of the 1016515 between the bridges 01
Stamford and Oxford were usually the same person, who was appointed
to both offices by the same letters patent.

The hereditary wardens were liable to lose their offices sor mis· Ἀ
conduct. Robert of Evei·ingl1an1,for example, was removed ¹ from his
office in the year 1287 35 3 punishment for committing various grave
offences, including the appropriation of the king’s deer to his own
use. On the other hand, Peter de Neville, in spite of the shameful
conduct of which he was convicted '2 in the forest eyre of the year 1269,
remained in possession 3 of his office. In general, 35 might have been
expected, there was more irregularity and oppression in the forests
where there was an hereditary warden than in those where the
wardens held office during the king's pleasure.

Misleading titles were often applied to the wardens, such 35
steward, bailiff, or chief forester. In letters patent the king is
usually expressed to have granted the wardenship 01 3 101651 10 1116
person appointed, who in consequence may appropriately be described
as a warden. On the other hand, the wardens are often described on
the forest eyre rolls 35 ‘stewards’ Thus John Mansel, to whom the
king granted the wardenship⁴ 01 1116 1016515 between the bridges of

101· trespasses in Rutland forest. (See

³ By letters close dated 17 November
1269, the king 1111661611 the justice 01 1116
forest to deliver to Peter de Neville his
bailiwick 01 Butland which had been taken
into the king's hand, the said Peter having
found sureties to answer for his trespass.
(See Close Roll 91, 111. 12.) It is probable
that he committed other offences in the
forest, 101· 011 1 February 127233, an order
was sent to admit him to bail to answer

mulgated against hini, for an offence com-
mitted on 7 October 1273. (See Inq. post
mortem, 3 Ed. 1., No. 64.)
