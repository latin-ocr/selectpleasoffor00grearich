since the last eyre and before the grants of 126ss and 1267. The
justiccs were not concerned with anything that happened in these
forests aster they had passed out of the king's hands. This state of
things, however, did not continue long. On 25 May 1285, Edward I.
granted a privilege to his brother Edmund, which was not allowed to
other lords of chases. He permitted him to have ι1051100510 hold
pleas 01 1110 101051 according to the assize of the forest in the 1010515
which he had by the grant 01 Henry HL, as often as justices should
be sent to hold 1110-«15 111 1110 king’s forests. The words 01 1110 1011015 ⁴
patentl are as follows:

Pro Edmundo fratre regis.

After the date 01 111050 1011015 patent the 1010515 01 Pickering
and Lancashire were subject to all 1110 laws which prevailed in the
royal forests. The records of the eyres held by the justices of the
earls are of the same form and deal with precisely the same matters ’
05 111050 which were held before the justices of the king. But although
the privilege 01 having justices so granted 10 1110 earl of Lancaster
was in the time of Edward I. unique, something very like it had been
sought and perhaps obtained earlier in the century. Robert earl
of Derby, whose earldom and honour, as we have seen, was granted
to Edmund Crouchback in 1266, had himself applied³ for leave to
hold pleas of the forest in his forest between the rivers Ribble and
Mersey. The substance of the king's answer seems to have been a
(1110011011 101 011 inquiry as to what had been done in the matter on
previous occasions.
