statute& asxvess concerning the knig and the peopka In trespasses
for which amercement was the penalty, the plea was to be finally
determined‚ and amends were to be made to the plaintiff. In those
in which ransom or imprisonment was the penalty, amends were to
be forthwith adj udged to the plaintiff‚ and the trespassers were to be
put by good mainprise to be before the king at the parliament next
ensuing ; if not, they were to abide in prison, and the justices were to
inqrnre ostheirlands and goods and of the naanner of the trespasa
and certify the king thereos at the parliament‚ that he might punish
them according to their deserts.

After the date of this statute large liunibers of cornsssaints of
trespasses were heard and determined by justices specially appointed
finssthe purpose. As the hssffiers patent by wdncllthey were appointed
were endorsed upon the Patent Rolls, we can obtain a considerable
amount of information about the operation of the statute. It was the

Although a park was a district enclosed with a paling, while a
cbase was usually not enclosed at all, the chief distinction between
chases and parks is to be found in the laws which were applicable to
them. In the chase certain beasts were the property of the lord and
were preserved as such by the laws of the forest. These laws were
enforced in dhflhrent degrees in <Hfierent chahes, but rffnvhere·were
they part of the ordinaoeyrlawrof the huid. ΊΠ16 park, on the other
hand, was not subject to the forest law. No beasts can be described
in law as beasts of the park. The deer which parks contained and
