be at Reading on the Sth July. We may therefore assume that they
held a session in eyre in Essex in the spring, after leaving Oxford and
before going into Rutland, and another session in Berkshire and Surrey
in the autumn after leaving Rutland.

On the 17th October 1256 the king sent letters patent ¹ to William
le Breton and his fellows appointing them justices in another group of
counties. By a strange error the enrolment of the letters patent
omits the names of these counties, and has instead the words ‘in
predictis comitatibus.’ It is probable that the counties mentioned in
the original letters patent were Hampshire and Wiltshire, as there
was a forest eyre in both of these counties in the following year. Rolls
of the Hampshire and Wiltshire eyre still exist ; but they happen to be
peculiar in having no headings 2 giving the dates at which the justices
began to hear their pleas. Internal evidence, however, proves that
the sessions 3 111 eyre in these counties, which comprised a large
number of forests, were held in the year 1257.

The history of the rest of the eyre is not obscured by the want of
documentary evidence. We learn from a memorandum ⁴¹ on the Close
Roll of 41 Hen. ΠΙ. that William le Breton‚ Nicholas of Romsey,
Geoffrey of Lewknor and Alexander de Montfort (who took the place
of Simon of Thorp) were directed to hold pleas of the forests of Dorset
at Dorchester 011 the 12th November 1257. It appears, however,
from the rolls ⁵ of the eyre that the justices actually began their work
on the 7th November. On the 26th November they were hearing
pleas ⁰ of the Somerset forests, having been constituted j ustices for the
purpose by letters ⁷ patent dated the Sth November; and on the aoth
J anuary 1258, they were at Gloucester hearing pleas⁸ of the forest

Baptiste in quindecim dies! There is a
similar enti-y on the rolls of the Oxford
eyre. (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, No. 251,

² Although there is no general heading
to the rolls of the Wiltshire eyre, the
following special heading occurs on one of
the rolls, which contains some transcripts
of forest charters: ‘ Transcriptum cartarum
in comitatu Wiltes’ de itinere R. Walarund,
W. le Bretun, N. de Romes' et G. de
Leukenour’ apud Wilton’ anno regni
regis Henrici quadragesimo primo.’ (For.
Proc„ Tomos Rec.,No. 198, Rolz 20.) Robert
&Valerand was justice of the forest south of
the Trent at this time, but he took no part
in the forest eyre in any of the other
counties (except perhaps Hampshire). He
was probably merely filling the place of
Simon of 'l‘horp, which was afterwards

taken by Alexander de Montfort.

²³ The letters patent of the bishop of
Salisbury extracted from the rolls and
printed on p. lxxxix below show that the
Wiltshire eyre almost certainly took place
after 15 June 1257.

is as follows: ‘I'lacita foreste in comitatu

Leonardi anno regni regis quadragesimo

is a special heading to the essoins :
