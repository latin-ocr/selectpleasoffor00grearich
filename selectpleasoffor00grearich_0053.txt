THE LESSER COURTS OF THE FOREST XlV

in the forest of Rockingham in the years 19 10 24 Edward 1.,1 upon
which the lost rolls of the next forest eyre were, no doubt based, but
the inquisitions have none of the features 01 1110 special inquisition.
They were not held for the purpose of inquiring into any particular
trespass or events. On the contrary, they were concerned with any
trespasses which might have been recently committed, trespasses
against the vert as well as trespasses against the venison. They were
held, 100, at such irregular intervals and in so many different places
that it would be impossible 10 arrive at any general rule as to when
and where they were held. One² was held at Brigstock on the 6th ‘Sepa
tember 1292 before the deputy justice of the forest south 01 1110 Τ10111
by the deputy warden 01· steward of the forest between 1110 bridges 01
Oxford and Stamford, two riding 101001010, 111100 verderers and twelve
as well knights as free and loyal men 01 1110 neighbouring parts 01
1110 101001. Another³ was held at Geddington on the 2nd January
129} before two deputy ε10011000 01 1110 forest south 01 1110 'Frent by the
verderers,⁴ foresters, regarderS, woodwards and neighbouring town—
ships. Usually, however, the inquisition was held before the justice
of the forest or his deputy by the foresters, verderers and twelve
jurors.

These inquisitions, which gradually took the place 01 1110 special
inquisitione of the reign of Henry HL, may be conveniently called
general inquisition& but they sometimes received the name of swani-
motes. Many of the general inquisitions 5 which were held in the
forest of Whittlewood during the years 22 10 31 Edward Lare de-
scribed6 as having been held ‘in pleno swanimotto.' In the year
1306 the new desig'nation ‘swanimote' obtained a statutory sanction.
In the statute ⁷ 01 that year known as ‘ Ordinatio Forestae,’ the general
- inquisition is called the swanimote and the mode of holding it is

⁴ In this inquisition the names 01 the
individual officers are not recorded:

⁵ For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea, No. 83. The
roll contains both general and special in-
quisitions held at irregular intervals. It
should not be assumed that the special
inquisition fell into disuse in some forests
as soon as it did in others. The procedure
in the middle of the reign of Edward i.
seems 10 have varied considerably in
different forests. Thus in the forest of
Oliffe from 16 to 34 Edward i. it was quite
usual for a special inquisition to be held, if
there was need for one, at the court 01

011001111101110, but general inquisitions were
also held from time to time (For. Proa,
Tr. of Rea, No. 79). In the forest 01
Salcey both special and general inquisitions
were held at intel-vals 110111 15 10 33 Ed-
ward i. (For. Proc„ Tr. of Rea„ No. 78).
The three 10110 mentioned in this note are
of considerable length, and supply useful
material for the history of the lesser eourts
of the forest in the reign 01 Edward i.
Few records of inquisitions, held at this
period, in other forests still exist.

ὅ It will be remembered that in the neigh-
bouring forests of Cliffe and Rutland the
courts 01 attachment were called ‘swani-

motes ’ (see p. xxxvii above).
