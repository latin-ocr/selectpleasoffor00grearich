THE CHASE, THE PARK AND THE WARREN CXXlX

cases of trespass which are recorded upon the plea rolls. Like the
hare, the fox is sometimes mentioned in charters of warren.1 But
although foxes do not appear to have given rise to cases of trespass,
they were undoubtedly beasts of warren. On the other hand,
although the coney is not mentioned in charters of warren, there are
cases of trespasses in warrens which show that the coney ² was con-
sidered to be in the same class as the hare and the fox.

Besides beasts there were also fowls of warren. In the Year
Book ³ of 21 and 22 Ed. Ι. 1110 following statement occurs :

Sire aver chase est proprement a deyms e deymes; e aver gareyne coe
est proprement de levers e conyges e perdryz.

This must not, however, be taken as an exhaustive list either
of the beasts of the chase or of the beasts and fowls of the
warren. For example, the red deer ought to be included in
the former and the fox in the latter class. Again, the pheasant
was undoubtedly a fowl of the warren, although not mentioned
in the list. A special commission of oyer and terminer was
appointed‘¹ in April 1300 concerning a trespass committed by certain
persons who entered the free warren of Burgate‚ hunted in it
and carried away hares, coneys and pheasants. Other similar com-
missions⁵ were appointed from time to time to hear and determine
trespasses in particular warrens committed by persons carrying away
the same beasts and fowls. There is also evidence of other birds
being treated as fowls of the warren.6 It is recorded 011 a roll of pleas
of the warren of Cambridge that divers persons were wont to 011101· 1110
warren with nets and to take plovers and ⁵ such like wild fowl.’ Even
more remarkable is the fact that the lark was treated as a fowl of the
warren in the manor of Kemerton in Gloucestershire. The case⁷
from Which this information is derived is sufficiently interesting to
be printed in full. It occurs in an eyre of the year 15 Ed. Ι. ;
