THE EXTENT OF THE FORESTS XCVll
with the report concerning the forests which had been afforested by
Henry H. or his foresters. There is certainly no entry 011 1118 Ρ818111
or Close Rolls directing a disafforestment in consequence of the report
of the justices. But the absence of such 8 direction is not conclusive
evidence that no disafforestment took place.

On 10 December 1223, 1118 attestation of letters patent and
close by Hubert of Burgh ceased and henceforth they are attested
by the king himself. But the ordinance in restraint of grants in
perpetuity remained in force, the king being still an infant.

On 30 October 1224, Hugh de Neville‚ the justice ¹ of the forest,
was directed ² to cause the forest to be kept and the regards to be made
as in the reign of king John before the war between him and his
barons. This direction is recorded on the patent rolls without any
introductory or explanatory statement3 but it certainly does not
amount 10 8 revocation of the Charter of the Forest, as it only affects
two of its chapters. On 11 February, in the following year the
Charter was again issued without any alteration in its provisions;
but it is expressed to be made ‘spontanea et bona uoluntate nostra,’
and concludes with a statement that it was granted in return for a
fifteenth of all movables, and that neither the king nor his heirs would
purchase anything by which the liberties contained in the chartei·
should be infringed, and that if 118 should purch-ase any such thing it
should be reckoned as null.

On 16 February 1225, being five days only after the second issue
of the Charter, justices 3 were appointed ‘¹ to make perambulations in
accordance with its provisions3 and on the same day the sheriff of
York was directed to cause its observance in 1118 bailiwick. Woods,
however, were not to be felled or venison taken on account of the
perambulation until it had been made and presented to the king
and he had given such orders as should seem good to him and
his council. Similar directions were sent on the same day to the

of the forest by letters patent dated 29 April
1224. (See Patent Roll 31, m. 8.)
